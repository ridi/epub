He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go. His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!<\\/p> <p>This final feather broke the camel\\u2019s back.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c11\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00015\\">CHAPTER XI<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img101\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"11-101.jpg (179K)\\" src=\\"\\/08453f83a51e113882961b67ad979e24ae9c6ed2.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph; the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house, with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave holi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img102\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"11-102.jpg (49K)\\" src=\\"\\/357260ceb897ced522a96fda5c53175f7adfdcfa.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter\\u2014so the story ran. And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the \\u201cbranch\\u201d about one or two o\\u2019clock in the morning, and that Potter had at once sneaked off\\u2014suspicious circumstances, especially the washing which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had been ransacked for this \\u201cmurderer\\u201d (the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff \\u201cwas confident\\u201d that he would be captured before night.<\\/p> <p>All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom\\u2019s heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful, unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry\\u2019s. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPoor fellow!\\u201d \\u201cPoor young fellow!\\u201d \\u201cThis ought to be a lesson to grave robbers!\\u201d \\u201cMuff Potter\\u2019ll hang for this if they catch him!\\u201d This was the drift of remark; and the minister said, \\u201cIt was a judgment; His hand is here.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and voices shouted, \\u201cIt\\u2019s him! it\\u2019s him! he\\u2019s coming himself!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho?

The poor fellow\\u2019s face was haggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t do it, friends,\\u201d he sobbed; \\u201c\\u2019pon my word and honor I never done it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img103\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"11-103.jpg (112K)\\" src=\\"\\/4d6025a223d9f0d9b0bb08266ab16b838ad04010.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s accused you?\\u201d shouted a voice.<\\/p> <p>This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Injun Joe, you promised me you\\u2019d never\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIs that your knife?\\u201d and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.<\\/p> <p>Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground.

And when he had finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner\\u2019s life faded and vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you leave? What did you want to come here for?\\u201d somebody said.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t help it\\u2014I couldn\\u2019t help it,\\u201d Potter moaned. \\u201cI wanted to run away, but I couldn\\u2019t seem to come anywhere but here.\\u201d And he fell to sobbing again.<\\/p> <p>Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face.<\\/p> <p>They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.<\\/p> <p>Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom\\u2019s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a bad sign,\\u201d said Aunt Polly, gravely. \\u201cWhat you got on your mind, Tom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNothing. Nothing \\u2019t I know of.\\u201d But the boy\\u2019s hand shook so that he spilled his coffee.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd you do talk such stuff,\\u201d Sid said. \\u201cLast night you said, \\u2018It\\u2019s blood, it\\u2019s blood, that\\u2019s what it is!\\u2019 You said that over and over. And you said, \\u2018Don\\u2019t torment me so\\u2014I\\u2019ll tell!\\u2019 Tell <i>what<\\/i>? What is it you\\u2019ll tell?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly\\u2019s face and she came to Tom\\u2019s relief without knowing it. She said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSho! It\\u2019s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night myself. Sometimes I dream it\\u2019s me that done it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom\\u2019s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom\\u2019s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.<\\/p> <p>It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness\\u2014and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom\\u2019s conscience.<\\/p> <p>Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts through to the \\u201cmurderer\\u201d as he could get hold of. The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom\\u2019s conscience.<\\/p> <p>The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img106\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"11-106.jpg (17K)\\" src=\\"\\/053608c47e56d969947dc2b3729006e2ee784c25.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c12\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00016\\">CHAPTER XII<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img107\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"12-107.jpg (179K)\\" src=\\"\\/b073bd5e0e7dd7067750007418e69db992285396.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>ONE of the reasons why Tom\\u2019s mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to \\u201cwhistle her down the wind,\\u201d but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father\\u2019s house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the \\u201cHealth\\u201d periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the \\u201crot\\u201d they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one\\u2019s self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with \\u201chell following after.\\u201d But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img108\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"12-108.jpg (51K)\\" src=\\"\\/302a4df631ea17ae927473b5b08ce927a0e0463a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The water treatment was new, now, and Tom\\u2019s low condition was a windfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and \\u201cthe yellow stains of it came through his pores\\u201d\\u2014as Tom said.<\\/p> <p>Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug\\u2019s, and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.<\\/p> <p>Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase filled the old lady\\u2019s heart with consternation. This indifference must be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the \\u201cindifference\\u201d was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.<\\/p> <p>Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it.<\\/p> <p>One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt\\u2019s yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a taste. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>But Peter signified that he did want it.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou better make sure.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Peter was sure.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow you\\u2019ve asked for it, and I\\u2019ll give it to you, because there ain\\u2019t anything mean about me; but if you find you don\\u2019t like it, you mustn\\u2019t blame anybody but your own self.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, what on earth ails that cat?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, aunt,\\u201d gasped the boy.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDeed I don\\u2019t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they\\u2019re having a good time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img110\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"12-110.jpg (106K)\\" src=\\"\\/2583dc85afb25021d530f1329298db566cb6689c.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cThey do, do they?\\u201d There was something in the tone that made Tom apprehensive.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2019m.

Too late he divined her \\u201cdrift.\\u201d The handle of the telltale tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle\\u2014his ear\\u2014and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI done it out of pity for him\\u2014because he hadn\\u2019t any aunt.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHadn\\u2019t any aunt!\\u2014you numskull. What has that got to do with it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHeaps. Because if he\\u2019d had one she\\u2019d a burnt him out herself! She\\u2019d a roasted his bowels out of him \\u2019thout any more feeling than if he was a human!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat <i>might<\\/i> be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom\\u2019s head and said gently:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it <i>did<\\/i> do you good.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done <i>him<\\/i> good, too. I never see him get around so since\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, go \\u2019long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and see if you can\\u2019t be a good boy, for once, and you needn\\u2019t take any more medicine.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking\\u2014down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom\\u2019s face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and \\u201cled up\\u201d warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom\\u2019s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out, and \\u201cgoing on\\u201d like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head\\u2014doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy\\u2019s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky\\u2019s nose, almost upsetting her\\u2014and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: \\u201cMf! some people think they\\u2019re mighty smart\\u2014always showing off!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom\\u2019s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and crestfallen.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img112\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"12-112.jpg (17K)\\" src=\\"\\/c41c17f3e32fc2a26bad101f7dc34e84fb8660cc.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c13\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00017\\">CHAPTER XIII<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img113\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"13-113.jpg (173K)\\" src=\\"\\/34868156f48c079a462a20abe86dac929581afa3.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>TOM\\u2019S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame <i>him<\\/i> for the consequences\\u2014why shouldn\\u2019t they?

Then the sobs came thick and fast.<\\/p> <p>Just at this point he met his soul\\u2019s sworn comrade, Joe Harper\\u2014hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart. Plainly here were \\u201ctwo souls with but a single thought.\\u201d Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.<\\/p> <p>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.<\\/p> <p>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.<\\/p> <p>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson\\u2019s Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour\\u2014which was midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way\\u2014as became outlaws. And before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would \\u201chear something.\\u201d All who got this vague hint were cautioned to \\u201cbe mum and wait.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho goes there?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.\\u201d Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.<\\/p> <p>\\u201c\\u2019Tis well. Give the countersign.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night:<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Blood<\\/i>!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.<\\/p> <p>The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or \\u201cchewed\\u201d but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, \\u201cHist!\\u201d every now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if \\u201cthe foe\\u201d stirred, to \\u201clet him have it to the hilt,\\u201d because \\u201cdead men tell no tales.\\u201d They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.<\\/p> <p>They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLuff, and bring her to the wind!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAye-aye, sir!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSteady, steady-y-y-y!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSteady it is, sir!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLet her go off a point!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPoint it is, sir!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for \\u201cstyle,\\u201d and were not intended to mean anything in particular.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat sail\\u2019s she carrying?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCourses, tops\\u2019ls, and flying-jib, sir.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSend the r\\u2019yals up!

The river was not high, so there was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, \\u201clooking his last\\u201d upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing \\u201cshe\\u201d could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson\\u2019s Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he \\u201clooked his last\\u201d with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o\\u2019clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft\\u2019s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as became outlaws.<\\/p> <p>They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \\u201cpone\\u201d stock they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild, free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.<\\/p> <p>When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img118\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"13-118.jpg (49K)\\" src=\\"\\/6bf8cd1fdcd0441babe2b5505fbd13508d7f13c3.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Ain\\u2019t<\\/i> it gay?\\u201d said Joe.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s <i>nuts<\\/i>!\\u201d said Tom. \\u201cWhat would the boys say if they could see us?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay?

You see a pirate don\\u2019t have to do <i>anything<\\/i>, Joe, when he\\u2019s ashore, but a hermit <i>he<\\/i> has to be praying considerable, and then he don\\u2019t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh yes, that\\u2019s so,\\u201d said Joe, \\u201cbut I hadn\\u2019t thought much about it, you know.

And a hermit\\u2019s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?\\u201d inquired Huck.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI dono. But they\\u2019ve <i>got<\\/i> to do it. Hermits always do. You\\u2019d have to do that if you was a hermit.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDern\\u2019d if I would,\\u201d said Huck.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, what would you do?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI dono. But I wouldn\\u2019t do that.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, Huck, you\\u2019d <i>have<\\/i> to. How\\u2019d you get around it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, I just wouldn\\u2019t stand it. I\\u2019d run away.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cRun away! Well, you <i>would<\\/i> be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You\\u2019d be a disgrace.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke\\u2014he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat does pirates have to do?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, they have just a bully time\\u2014take ships and burn them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there\\u2019s ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships\\u2014make \\u2019em walk a plank.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd they carry the women to the island,\\u201d said Joe; \\u201cthey don\\u2019t kill the women.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d assented Tom, \\u201cthey don\\u2019t kill the women\\u2014they\\u2019re too noble. And the women\\u2019s always beautiful, too.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd don\\u2019t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and di\\u2019monds,\\u201d said Joe, with enthusiasm.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho?\\u201d said Huck.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, the pirates.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI reckon I ain\\u2019t dressed fitten for a pirate,\\u201d said he, with a regretful pathos in his voice; \\u201cbut I ain\\u2019t got none but these.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.<\\/p> <p>Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep\\u2014but an intruder came, now, that would not \\u201cdown.\\u201d It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only \\u201chooking,\\u201d while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing\\u2014and there was a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c14\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00018\\">CHAPTER XIV<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img121\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"14-121.jpg (207K)\\" src=\\"\\/492dc23813ba61c69532ae5b9b7d99091dceb5c2.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature\\u2019s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck still slept.<\\/p> <p>Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and \\u201csniffing around,\\u201d then proceeding again\\u2014for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom\\u2019s leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad\\u2014for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes\\u2014without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, \\u201cLady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children\\u2019s alone,\\u201d and she took wing and went off to see about it\\u2014which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom\\u2019s head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy\\u2019s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the \\u201cfox\\u201d kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.<\\/p> <p>Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img123\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"14-123.jpg (54K)\\" src=\\"\\/6d0754b88d56c02ed804af56ac8e5c11206955cb.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish\\u2014provisions enough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.<\\/p> <p>They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img124\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> "}';
