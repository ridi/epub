Presently they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGet away from here!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGo away yourself!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t either.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a coward and a pup. I\\u2019ll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I\\u2019ll make him do it, too.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat do I care for your big brother? I\\u2019ve got a brother that\\u2019s bigger than he is\\u2014and what\\u2019s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\\u201d [Both brothers were imaginary.]<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a lie.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Your<\\/i> saying so don\\u2019t make it so.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI dare you to step over that, and I\\u2019ll lick you till you can\\u2019t stand up. Anybody that\\u2019ll take a dare will steal sheep.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow you said you\\u2019d do it, now let\\u2019s see you do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t you crowd me now; you better look out.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, you <i>said<\\/i> you\\u2019d do it\\u2014why don\\u2019t you do it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBy jingo! for two cents I <i>will<\\/i> do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other\\u2019s hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other\\u2019s nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. \\u201cHoller \\u2019nuff!\\u201d said he.<\\/p> <p>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying\\u2014mainly from rage.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHoller \\u2019nuff!\\u201d\\u2014and the pounding went on.<\\/p> <p>At last the stranger got out a smothered \\u201c\\u2019Nuff!\\u201d and Tom let him up and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow that\\u2019ll learn you. Better look out who you\\u2019re fooling with next time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the \\u201cnext time he caught him out.\\u201d To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At last the enemy\\u2019s mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he \\u201c\\u2019lowed\\u201d to \\u201clay\\u201d for that boy.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"01-025.jpg (55K)\\" src=\\"\\/a3217fabf6af03994f2f3874d8a0a718302f059d.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><\\/p> <h2>CHAPTER II<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-026.jpg (202K)\\" src=\\"\\/958d142caf60ea1185cec57e8357ce32eaefea77.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.<\\/p> <p>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\\u2019s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour\\u2014and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Jim, I\\u2019ll fetch the water if you\\u2019ll whitewash some.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Jim shook his head and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an\\u2019 git dis water an\\u2019 not stop foolin\\u2019 roun\\u2019 wid anybody.

That\\u2019s the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket\\u2014I won\\u2019t be gone only a a minute. <i>She<\\/i> won\\u2019t ever know.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, I dasn\\u2019t, Mars Tom.

He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-028.jpg (101K)\\" src=\\"\\/88716e98e70a5f3e2faba01fa9e85a08ab6b22b9.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>But Tom\\u2019s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work\\u2014the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined it\\u2014bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of <i>work<\\/i>, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration.<\\/p> <p>He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight presently\\u2014the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been dreading. Ben\\u2019s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump\\u2014proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance\\u2014for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cStop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\\u201d The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cShip up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\\u201d His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSet her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!\\u201d His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles\\u2014for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLet her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!\\u201d The left hand began to describe circles.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cStop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! <i>lively<\\/i> now! Come\\u2014out with your spring-line\\u2014what\\u2019re you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now\\u2014let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH\\u2019T! S\\u2019H\'T! SH\\u2019T!\\u201d (trying the gauge-cocks).<\\/p> <p>Tom went on whitewashing\\u2014paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: \\u201c<i>Hi-Yi! You\\u2019re<\\/i> up a stump, ain\\u2019t you!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom\\u2019s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom wheeled suddenly and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, it\\u2019s you, Ben! I warn\\u2019t noticing.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay\\u2014I\\u2019m going in a-swimming, I am. Don\\u2019t you wish you could? But of course you\\u2019d druther <i>work<\\/i>\\u2014wouldn\\u2019t you? Course you would!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat do you call work?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, ain\\u2019t <i>that<\\/i> work?\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-030.jpg (170K)\\" src=\\"\\/5245c1ee3665acc8fdd3c445ec8254bcdcd2aed3.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\\u2019t. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh come, now, you don\\u2019t mean to let on that you <i>like<\\/i> it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The brush continued to move.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLike it? Well, I don\\u2019t see why I oughtn\\u2019t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth\\u2014stepped back to note the effect\\u2014added a touch here and there\\u2014criticised the effect again\\u2014Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Tom, let <i>me<\\/i> whitewash a little.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2014no\\u2014I reckon it wouldn\\u2019t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly\\u2019s awful particular about this fence\\u2014right here on the street, you know\\u2014but if it was the back fence I wouldn\\u2019t mind and <i>she<\\/i> wouldn\\u2019t. Yes, she\\u2019s awful particular about this fence; it\\u2019s got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain\\u2019t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it\\u2019s got to be done.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2014is that so? Oh come, now\\u2014lemme just try. Only just a little\\u2014I\\u2019d let <i>you<\\/i>, if you was me, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBen, I\\u2019d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly\\u2014well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn\\u2019t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn\\u2019t let Sid. Now don\\u2019t you see how I\\u2019m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, shucks, I\\u2019ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say\\u2014I\\u2019ll give you the core of my apple.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, here\\u2014No, Ben, now don\\u2019t. I\\u2019m afeard\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll give you <i>all<\\/i> of it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with\\u2014and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn\\u2019t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar\\u2014but no dog\\u2014the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-031.jpg (24K)\\" src=\\"\\/2b0f11b92028ede008b42a80ab87f4aaa1f04bcf.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while\\u2014plenty of company\\u2014and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn\\u2019t run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.<\\/p> <p>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it\\u2014namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is <i>obliged<\\/i> to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.<\\/p> <p>The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to report.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-032.jpg (48K)\\" src=\\"\\/41277f918ee18f4b4438a8e0291b4042d31afd40.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><\\/p> <h2>CHAPTER III<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-033.jpg (197K)\\" src=\\"\\/acc1ad3cec4375e69367630b5287720f74be0605.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting\\u2014for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: \\u201cMayn\\u2019t I go and play now, aunt?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat, a\\u2019ready? How much have you done?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s all done, aunt.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, don\\u2019t lie to me\\u2014I can\\u2019t bear it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI ain\\u2019t, aunt; it <i>is<\\/i> all done.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of Tom\\u2019s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I never! There\\u2019s no getting round it, you can work when you\\u2019re a mind to, Tom.\\u201d And then she diluted the compliment by adding, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s powerful seldom you\\u2019re a mind to, I\\u2019m bound to say. Well, go \\u2019long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I\\u2019ll tan you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he \\u201chooked\\u201d a doughnut.<\\/p> <p>Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-034.jpg (41K)\\" src=\\"\\/1f2646e9a03fb2aca21b0b637de8054c1cfed668.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt\\u2019s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two \\u201cmilitary\\u201d companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person\\u2014that being better suited to the still smaller fry\\u2014but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom\\u2019s army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-035.jpg (106K)\\" src=\\"\\/39bc6b2b8df85fec86e2c283a439a65c7d64859d.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden\\u2014a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.<\\/p> <p>He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to \\u201cshow off\\u201d in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-036.jpg (43K)\\" src=\\"\\/4863a5129b6032dfcdda1ea10a4f5ae2d0002d99.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute\\u2014only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart\\u2014or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.<\\/p> <p>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, \\u201cshowing off,\\u201d as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.<\\/p> <p>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered \\u201cwhat had got into the child.\\u201d He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt\\u2019s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAunt, you don\\u2019t whack Sid when he takes it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, Sid don\\u2019t torment a body the way you do. You\\u2019d be always into that sugar if I warn\\u2019t watching you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl\\u2014a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid\\u2019s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model \\u201ccatch it.\\u201d He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said to himself, \\u201cNow it\\u2019s coming!\\u201d And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHold on, now, what \\u2019er you belting <i>me<\\/i> for?\\u2014Sid broke it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when she got her tongue again, she only said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cUmf! Well, you didn\\u2019t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn\\u2019t around, like enough.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-038.jpg (60K)\\" src=\\"\\/5a248fc42bd8ed3dec08829af0e32a0d5dce0e0f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign\\u2014a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-039a.jpg (57K)\\" src=\\"\\/5dae7f6c847377efad0782d9b9b757be0e7a7ea4.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned, all at once ...<\\/p>"}';
