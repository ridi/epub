There in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the \\u201cha\\u2019nted\\u201d house, utterly isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c26\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00031\\">CHAPTER XVI<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img199\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"26-199.jpg (195K)\\" src=\\"\\/79cbff779677f57462f3f329e2680564a4109fe0.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come for their tools.

I never once thought of it, Huck!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBlame it, a body can\\u2019t be too careful, Huck.

There\\u2019s some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAny fool knows that. I don\\u2019t reckon <i>you<\\/i> was the first that found it out, Huck.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain\\u2019t all, neither.

All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We\\u2019ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo. Who\\u2019s Robin Hood?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England\\u2014and the best. He was a robber.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img200\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"26-200.jpg (42K)\\" src=\\"\\/ef54845ee6937d4d7d815eea2c12fadce12de00e.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cCracky, I wisht I was.

He always divided up with \\u2019em perfectly square.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, he must \\u2019a\\u2019 been a brick.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain\\u2019t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s a <i>yew<\\/i> bow?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know.

I\\u2019ll learn you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019m agreed.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow\\u2019s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.<\\/p> <p>On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again. They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.<\\/p> <p>When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.<\\/p> <p>In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result\\u2014they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud\\u2014there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSh!\\u201d said Tom.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d whispered Huck, blanching with fright.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSh!... There!... Hear it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes!... Oh, my! Let\\u2019s run!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cKeep still! Don\\u2019t you budge! They\\u2019re coming right toward the door.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ve stopped.... No\\u2014coming.... Here they are. Don\\u2019t whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: \\u201cThere\\u2019s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that\\u2019s been about town once or twice lately\\u2014never saw t\\u2019other man before.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cT\\u2019other\\u201d was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles. When they came in, \\u201ct\\u2019other\\u201d was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI\\u2019ve thought it all over, and I don\\u2019t like it. It\\u2019s dangerous.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDangerous!\\u201d grunted the \\u201cdeaf and dumb\\u201d Spaniard\\u2014to the vast surprise of the boys. \\u201cMilksop!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe\\u2019s! There was silence for some time. Then Joe said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s any more dangerous than that job up yonder\\u2014but nothing\\u2019s come of it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. \\u2019Twon\\u2019t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn\\u2019t succeed.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, what\\u2019s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!\\u2014anybody would suspicion us that saw us.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI know that. But there warn\\u2019t any other place as handy after that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn\\u2019t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThose infernal boys\\u201d quaked again under the inspiration of this remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a year.<\\/p> <p>The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook here, lad\\u2014you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there till you hear from me. I\\u2019ll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more, for a look. We\\u2019ll do that \\u2018dangerous\\u2019 job after I\\u2019ve spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas! We\\u2019ll leg it together!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019m dead for sleep! It\\u2019s your turn to watch.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.<\\/p> <p>The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow\\u2019s our chance\\u2014come!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t\\u2014I\\u2019d die if they was to wake.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom urged\\u2014Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray; and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.<\\/p> <p>Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around\\u2014smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees\\u2014stirred him up with his foot and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHere! <i>You\\u2019re<\\/i> a watchman, ain\\u2019t you! All right, though\\u2014nothing\\u2019s happened.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMy! have I been asleep?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What\\u2019ll we do with what little swag we\\u2019ve got left?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know\\u2014leave it here as we\\u2019ve always done, I reckon. No use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver\\u2019s something to carry.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell\\u2014all right\\u2014it won\\u2019t matter to come here once more.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2014but I\\u2019d say come in the night as we used to do\\u2014it\\u2019s better.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job; accidents might happen; \\u2019tain\\u2019t in such a very good place; we\\u2019ll just regularly bury it\\u2014and bury it deep.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGood idea,\\u201d said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down, raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.<\\/p> <p>The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!\\u2014the splendor of it was beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest auspices\\u2014there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig. They nudged each other every moment\\u2014eloquent nudges and easily understood, for they simply meant\\u2014\\u201cOh, but ain\\u2019t you glad <i>now<\\/i> we\\u2019re here!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Joe\\u2019s knife struck upon something.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHello!\\u201d said he.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d said his comrade.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHalf-rotten plank\\u2014no, it\\u2019s a box, I believe. Here\\u2014bear a hand and we\\u2019ll see what it\\u2019s here for. Never mind, I\\u2019ve broke a hole.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He reached his hand in and drew it out\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMan, it\\u2019s money!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.<\\/p> <p>Joe\\u2019s comrade said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll make quick work of this. There\\u2019s an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace\\u2014I saw it a minute ago.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He ran and brought the boys\\u2019 pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPard, there\\u2019s thousands of dollars here,\\u201d said Injun Joe.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img205\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"26-205.jpg (106K)\\" src=\\"\\/e7dd5c654a26acdc55f51a6f98d3366c96ef0711.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201c\\u2019Twas always said that Murrel\\u2019s gang used to be around here one summer,\\u201d the stranger observed.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI know it,\\u201d said Injun Joe; \\u201cand this looks like it, I should say.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow you won\\u2019t need to do that job.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The halfbreed frowned.

It\\u2019s nearly dark enough to start.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out. Presently he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be upstairs?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The boys\\u2019 breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs\\u2014the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads\\u2014they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow what\\u2019s the use of all that? If it\\u2019s anybody, and they\\u2019re up there, let them <i>stay<\\/i> there\\u2014who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes\\u2014and then let them follow us if they want to. I\\u2019m willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something.

Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.<\\/p> <p>Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much absorbed in hating themselves\\u2014hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his \\u201crevenge\\u201d was satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there!<\\/p> <p>They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to \\u201cNumber Two,\\u201d wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cRevenge? What if he means <i>us<\\/i>, Huck!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, don\\u2019t!\\u201d said Huck, nearly fainting.<\\/p> <p>They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else\\u2014at least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.<\\/p> <p>Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company would be a palpable improvement, he thought.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c27\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00032\\">CHAPTER XXVII<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img208\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"27-208.jpg (168K)\\" src=\\"\\/3fe13b2af7e05df009c48b857e705b6931686234.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom\\u2019s dreams that night. Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away\\u2014somewhat as if they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea\\u2014namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to \\u201chundreds\\u201d and \\u201cthousands\\u201d were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one\\u2019s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.<\\/p> <p>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHello, Huck!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHello, yourself.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Silence, for a minute.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, if we\\u2019d \\u2019a\\u2019 left the blame tools at the dead tree, we\\u2019d \\u2019a\\u2019 got the money.

Say, Huck\\u2014maybe it\\u2019s the number of a house!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGoody!... No, Tom, that ain\\u2019t it. If it is, it ain\\u2019t in this one-horse town. They ain\\u2019t no numbers here.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, that\\u2019s so. Lemme think a minute. Here\\u2014it\\u2019s the number of a room\\u2014in a tavern, you know!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, that\\u2019s the trick! They ain\\u2019t only two taverns. We can find out quick.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou stay here, Huck, till I come.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck\\u2019s company in public places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No. 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied. In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper\\u2019s young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was \\u201cha\\u2019nted\\u201d; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I\\u2019ve found out, Huck. I reckon that\\u2019s the very No. 2 we\\u2019re after.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLemme think.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom thought a long time. Then he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and I\\u2019ll nip all of auntie\\u2019s, and the first dark night we\\u2019ll go there and try \\u2019em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don\\u2019t go to that No. 2, that ain\\u2019t the place.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLordy, I don\\u2019t want to foller him by myself!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, it\\u2019ll be night, sure.

They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and \\u201cmaow,\\u201d whereupon he would slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img213\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"28-213.jpg (50K)\\" src=\\"\\/823a4e7e9d3584f014909b3bbd603540192d6609.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt\\u2019s old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in Huck\\u2019s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.<\\/p> <p>Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck\\u2019s spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern\\u2014it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him: \\u201cRun!\\u201d said he; \\u201crun, for your life!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He needn\\u2019t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn\\u2019t hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn\\u2019t turn in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn\\u2019t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, <i>Great Caesar\\u2019s Ghost!<\\/i>\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img214\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"28-214.jpg (95K)\\" src=\\"\\/db76a32e41867d7aeed2ba4cf1fe93028c2db86a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat!\\u2014what\\u2019d you see, Tom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe\\u2019s hand!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, never budged. Drunk, I reckon.

I didn\\u2019t see the box, I didn\\u2019t see the cross. I didn\\u2019t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don\\u2019t you see, now, what\\u2019s the matter with that ha\\u2019nted room?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHow?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, it\\u2019s ha\\u2019nted with whiskey!

If there\\u2019d been three, he\\u2019d be drunk enough and I\\u2019d do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe\\u2019s not in there. It\\u2019s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we\\u2019ll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we\\u2019ll snatch that box quicker\\u2019n lightning.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I\\u2019m agreed.

It\\u2019ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI said I would, Tom, and I will. I\\u2019ll ha\\u2019nt that tavern every night for a year! I\\u2019ll sleep all day and I\\u2019ll stand watch all night.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s all right.

Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy\\u2019s interest. He saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing \\u201chispy\\u201d and \\u201cgully-keeper\\u201d with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented. The child\\u2019s delight was boundless; and Tom\\u2019s not more moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. Tom\\u2019s excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck\\u2019s \\u201cmaow,\\u201d and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.<\\/p> <p>Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o\\u2019clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher\\u2019s, and everything was ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll not get back till late. Perhaps you\\u2019d better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThen I\\u2019ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cVery well. And mind and behave yourself and don\\u2019t be any trouble.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay\\u2014I\\u2019ll tell you what we\\u2019ll do. \\u2019Stead of going to Joe Harper\\u2019s we\\u2019ll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas\\u2019. She\\u2019ll have ice-cream! She has it most every day\\u2014dead loads of it. And she\\u2019ll be awful glad to have us.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, that will be fun!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBut what will mamma say?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHow\\u2019ll she ever know?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI reckon it\\u2019s wrong\\u2014but\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBut shucks! Your mother won\\u2019t know, and so what\\u2019s the harm? All she wants is that you\\u2019ll be safe; and I bet you she\\u2019d \\u2019a\\u2019 said go there if she\\u2019d \\u2019a\\u2019 thought of it. I know she would!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The Widow Douglas\\u2019 splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom\\u2019s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night\\u2019s programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas\\u2019. And why should he give it up, he reasoned\\u2014the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.<\\/p> <p>Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s ready for the cave?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside\\u2014an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand\\u2014for McDougal\\u2019s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same\\u2014labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man \\u201cknew\\u201d the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img220\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"29-220.jpg (101K)\\" src=\\"\\/d997ea5b2d2bcd3f40d31fe63af1f3c2d8654e4f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the \\u201cknown\\u201d ground.<\\/p> <p>By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day\\u2019s adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img221\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"29-221.jpg (52K)\\" src=\\"\\/c635dc6fcce3d15e9b712dfeaab12a8e61a9a5b7.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat\\u2019s lights went glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf\\u2014and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o\\u2019clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. Eleven o\\u2019clock came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?<\\/p> <p>A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It would be absurd\\u2014the men would get away with the box and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.<\\/p> <p>They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman\\u2019s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill\\u2014ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck\\u2019s heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas\\u2019 grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won\\u2019t be hard to find.<\\/p> <p>Now there was a voice\\u2014a very low voice\\u2014Injun Joe\\u2019s:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDamn her, maybe she\\u2019s got company\\u2014there\\u2019s lights, late as it is.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t see any.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>This was that stranger\\u2019s voice\\u2014the stranger of the haunted house. A deadly chill went to Huck\\u2019s heart\\u2014this, then, was the \\u201crevenge\\u201d job! His thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn\\u2019t dare\\u2014they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger\\u2019s remark and Injun Joe\\u2019s next\\u2014which was\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecause the bush is in your way. Now\\u2014this way\\u2014now you see, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes. Well, there <i>is<\\/i> company there, I reckon. Better give it up.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGive it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I\\u2019ve told you before, I don\\u2019t care for her swag\\u2014you may have it. But her husband was rough on me\\u2014many times he was rough on me\\u2014and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain\\u2019t all. It ain\\u2019t a millionth part of it! He had me <i>horsewhipped<\\/i>!\\u2014horsewhipped in front of the jail, like a nigger!\\u2014with all the town looking on! <i>Horsewhipped<\\/i>!\\u2014do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But I\\u2019ll take it out of <i>her<\\/i>.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, don\\u2019t kill her! Don\\u2019t do that!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cKill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill <i>him<\\/i> if he was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don\\u2019t kill her\\u2014bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils\\u2014you notch her ears like a sow!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBy God, that\\u2019s\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cKeep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I\\u2019ll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I\\u2019ll not cry, if she does. My friend, you\\u2019ll help me in this thing\\u2014for <i>my<\\/i> sake\\u2014that\\u2019s why you\\u2019re here\\u2014I mightn\\u2019t be able alone. If you flinch, I\\u2019ll kill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I\\u2019ll kill her\\u2014and then I reckon nobody\\u2019ll ever know much about who done this business.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, if it\\u2019s got to be done, let\\u2019s get at it. The quicker the better\\u2014I\\u2019m all in a shiver.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDo it <i>now<\\/i>? And company there? Look here\\u2014I\\u2019ll get suspicious of you, first thing you know. No\\u2014we\\u2019ll wait till the lights are out\\u2014there\\u2019s no hurry.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue\\u2014a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and\\u2014a twig snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no sound\\u2014the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes\\u2014turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship\\u2014and then stepped quickly but cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he reached the Welshman\\u2019s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img224\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> "}';
