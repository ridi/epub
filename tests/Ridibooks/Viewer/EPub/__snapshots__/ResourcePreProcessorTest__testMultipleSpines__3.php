Presently they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGet away from here!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGo away yourself!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t either.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a coward and a pup. I\\u2019ll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I\\u2019ll make him do it, too.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat do I care for your big brother? I\\u2019ve got a brother that\\u2019s bigger than he is\\u2014and what\\u2019s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\\u201d [Both brothers were imaginary.]<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a lie.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Your<\\/i> saying so don\\u2019t make it so.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI dare you to step over that, and I\\u2019ll lick you till you can\\u2019t stand up. Anybody that\\u2019ll take a dare will steal sheep.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow you said you\\u2019d do it, now let\\u2019s see you do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t you crowd me now; you better look out.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, you <i>said<\\/i> you\\u2019d do it\\u2014why don\\u2019t you do it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBy jingo! for two cents I <i>will<\\/i> do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other\\u2019s hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other\\u2019s nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. \\u201cHoller \\u2019nuff!\\u201d said he.<\\/p> <p>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying\\u2014mainly from rage.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHoller \\u2019nuff!\\u201d\\u2014and the pounding went on.<\\/p> <p>At last the stranger got out a smothered \\u201c\\u2019Nuff!\\u201d and Tom let him up and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow that\\u2019ll learn you. Better look out who you\\u2019re fooling with next time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the \\u201cnext time he caught him out.\\u201d To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At last the enemy\\u2019s mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he \\u201c\\u2019lowed\\u201d to \\u201clay\\u201d for that boy.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img025\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"01-025.jpg (55K)\\" src=\\"\\/a3217fabf6af03994f2f3874d8a0a718302f059d.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c2\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00006\\">CHAPTER II<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img026\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-026.jpg (202K)\\" src=\\"\\/958d142caf60ea1185cec57e8357ce32eaefea77.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.<\\/p> <p>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom\\u2019s eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour\\u2014and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Jim, I\\u2019ll fetch the water if you\\u2019ll whitewash some.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Jim shook his head and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an\\u2019 git dis water an\\u2019 not stop foolin\\u2019 roun\\u2019 wid anybody.

That\\u2019s the way she always talks. Gimme the bucket\\u2014I won\\u2019t be gone only a a minute. <i>She<\\/i> won\\u2019t ever know.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, I dasn\\u2019t, Mars Tom.

She talks awful, but talk don\\u2019t hurt\\u2014anyways it don\\u2019t if she don\\u2019t cry. Jim, I\\u2019ll give you a marvel. I\\u2019ll give you a white alley!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Jim began to waver.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhite alley, Jim! And it\\u2019s a bully taw.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMy!

He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img028\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-028.jpg (101K)\\" src=\\"\\/88716e98e70a5f3e2faba01fa9e85a08ab6b22b9.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>But Tom\\u2019s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work\\u2014the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined it\\u2014bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of <i>work<\\/i>, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration.<\\/p> <p>He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight presently\\u2014the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been dreading. Ben\\u2019s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump\\u2014proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance\\u2014for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cStop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\\u201d The headway ran almost out, and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cShip up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\\u201d His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSet her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow! Chow!\\u201d His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles\\u2014for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLet her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!\\u201d The left hand began to describe circles.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cStop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! <i>lively<\\/i> now! Come\\u2014out with your spring-line\\u2014what\\u2019re you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now\\u2014let her go! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH\\u2019T! S\\u2019H\'T! SH\\u2019T!\\u201d (trying the gauge-cocks).<\\/p> <p>Tom went on whitewashing\\u2014paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: \\u201c<i>Hi-Yi! You\\u2019re<\\/i> up a stump, ain\\u2019t you!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom\\u2019s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom wheeled suddenly and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, it\\u2019s you, Ben! I warn\\u2019t noticing.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay\\u2014I\\u2019m going in a-swimming, I am. Don\\u2019t you wish you could? But of course you\\u2019d druther <i>work<\\/i>\\u2014wouldn\\u2019t you? Course you would!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat do you call work?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, ain\\u2019t <i>that<\\/i> work?\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img030\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-030.jpg (170K)\\" src=\\"\\/5245c1ee3665acc8fdd3c445ec8254bcdcd2aed3.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, maybe it is, and maybe it ain\\u2019t. All I know, is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh come, now, you don\\u2019t mean to let on that you <i>like<\\/i> it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The brush continued to move.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLike it? Well, I don\\u2019t see why I oughtn\\u2019t to like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth\\u2014stepped back to note the effect\\u2014added a touch here and there\\u2014criticised the effect again\\u2014Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. Presently he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Tom, let <i>me<\\/i> whitewash a little.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2014no\\u2014I reckon it wouldn\\u2019t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly\\u2019s awful particular about this fence\\u2014right here on the street, you know\\u2014but if it was the back fence I wouldn\\u2019t mind and <i>she<\\/i> wouldn\\u2019t. Yes, she\\u2019s awful particular about this fence; it\\u2019s got to be done very careful; I reckon there ain\\u2019t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it the way it\\u2019s got to be done.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2014is that so? Oh come, now\\u2014lemme just try. Only just a little\\u2014I\\u2019d let <i>you<\\/i>, if you was me, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBen, I\\u2019d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly\\u2014well, Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn\\u2019t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn\\u2019t let Sid. Now don\\u2019t you see how I\\u2019m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, shucks, I\\u2019ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say\\u2014I\\u2019ll give you the core of my apple.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, here\\u2014No, Ben, now don\\u2019t. I\\u2019m afeard\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll give you <i>all<\\/i> of it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with\\u2014and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn\\u2019t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar\\u2014but no dog\\u2014the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img031\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-031.jpg (24K)\\" src=\\"\\/2b0f11b92028ede008b42a80ab87f4aaa1f04bcf.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while\\u2014plenty of company\\u2014and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn\\u2019t run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.<\\/p> <p>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it\\u2014namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is <i>obliged<\\/i> to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.<\\/p> <p>The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to report.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img032\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"02-032.jpg (48K)\\" src=\\"\\/41277f918ee18f4b4438a8e0291b4042d31afd40.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c3\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00007\\">CHAPTER III<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img033\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-033.jpg (197K)\\" src=\\"\\/acc1ad3cec4375e69367630b5287720f74be0605.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting\\u2014for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: \\u201cMayn\\u2019t I go and play now, aunt?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat, a\\u2019ready? How much have you done?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s all done, aunt.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, don\\u2019t lie to me\\u2014I can\\u2019t bear it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI ain\\u2019t, aunt; it <i>is<\\/i> all done.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of Tom\\u2019s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I never! There\\u2019s no getting round it, you can work when you\\u2019re a mind to, Tom.\\u201d And then she diluted the compliment by adding, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s powerful seldom you\\u2019re a mind to, I\\u2019m bound to say. Well, go \\u2019long and play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I\\u2019ll tan you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he \\u201chooked\\u201d a doughnut.<\\/p> <p>Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img034\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-034.jpg (41K)\\" src=\\"\\/1f2646e9a03fb2aca21b0b637de8054c1cfed668.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt\\u2019s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two \\u201cmilitary\\u201d companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person\\u2014that being better suited to the still smaller fry\\u2014but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom\\u2019s army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img035\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-035.jpg (106K)\\" src=\\"\\/39bc6b2b8df85fec86e2c283a439a65c7d64859d.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden\\u2014a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pan-talettes.

He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.<\\/p> <p>He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to \\u201cshow off\\u201d in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img036\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-036.jpg (43K)\\" src=\\"\\/4863a5129b6032dfcdda1ea10a4f5ae2d0002d99.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute\\u2014only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart\\u2014or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.<\\/p> <p>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, \\u201cshowing off,\\u201d as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.<\\/p> <p>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered \\u201cwhat had got into the child.\\u201d He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt\\u2019s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAunt, you don\\u2019t whack Sid when he takes it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, Sid don\\u2019t torment a body the way you do. You\\u2019d be always into that sugar if I warn\\u2019t watching you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl\\u2014a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid\\u2019s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model \\u201ccatch it.\\u201d He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said to himself, \\u201cNow it\\u2019s coming!\\u201d And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHold on, now, what \\u2019er you belting <i>me<\\/i> for?\\u2014Sid broke it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when she got her tongue again, she only said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cUmf! Well, you didn\\u2019t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn\\u2019t around, like enough.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img038\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-038.jpg (60K)\\" src=\\"\\/5a248fc42bd8ed3dec08829af0e32a0d5dce0e0f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign\\u2014a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img039a\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-039a.jpg (57K)\\" src=\\"\\/5dae7f6c847377efad0782d9b9b757be0e7a7ea4.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img039b\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-039b.jpg (36K)\\" src=\\"\\/3086e61e9b9042dec31ff62df34c4a235e18db58.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>About half-past nine or ten o\\u2019clock he came along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And thus he would die\\u2014out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And thus <i>she<\\/i> would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?<\\/p> <p>The window went up, a maid-servant\\u2019s discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr\\u2019s remains!<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img040\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"03-040.jpg (89K)\\" src=\\"\\/9118e5080c6f8ccc744be8e2b8c224ff5a753b84.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort.

Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.<\\/p> <p>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to \\u201cget his verses.\\u201d Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter. At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBlessed are the\\u2014a\\u2014a\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPoor\\u201d\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2014poor; blessed are the poor\\u2014a\\u2014a\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIn spirit\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIn spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they\\u2014they\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Theirs<\\/i>\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cFor <i>theirs<\\/i>.

You must go and learn it again. Don\\u2019t you be discouraged, Tom, you\\u2019ll manage it\\u2014and if you do, I\\u2019ll give you something ever so nice. There, now, that\\u2019s a good boy.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAll right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNever you mind, Tom. You know if I say it\\u2019s nice, it is nice.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou bet you that\\u2019s so, Mary. All right, I\\u2019ll tackle it again.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>And he did \\u201ctackle it again\\u201d\\u2014and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new \\u201cBarlow\\u201d knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a \\u201csure-enough\\u201d Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that\\u2014though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img044\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"04-044.jpg (46K)\\" src=\\"\\/3964c14c9f4179b2098a6861b132e1bcd0319c05.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But Mary removed the towel and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow ain\\u2019t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn\\u2019t be so bad. Water won\\u2019t hurt you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years\\u2014they were simply called his \\u201cother clothes\\u201d\\u2014and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe. The girl \\u201cput him to rights\\u201d after he had dressed himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn\\u2019t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPlease, Tom\\u2014that\\u2019s a good boy.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out for Sunday-school\\u2014a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img045\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"04-045.jpg (63K)\\" src=\\"\\/e1a3d9b6ec5ff63a5f9a3fbb8bb75ab4fb455295.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too\\u2014for stronger reasons. The church\\u2019s high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Billy, got a yaller ticket?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019ll you take for her?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019ll you give?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPiece of lickrish and a fish-hook.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLess see \\u2019em.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy\\u2019s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say \\u201cOuch!\\u201d and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom\\u2019s whole class were of a pattern\\u2014restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each got his reward\\u2014in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way\\u2014it was the patient work of two years\\u2014and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth\\u2014a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out and \\u201cspread himself.\\u201d Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar\\u2019s heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom\\u2019s mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img047\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"04-047.jpg (94K)\\" src=\\"\\/e9d0cf7b8476994e944bd585467c7eb8faff1e3b.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert\\u2014though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth\\u2014a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners\\u2014an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this fashion:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There\\u2014that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of the window\\u2014I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere\\u2014perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.\\u201d And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.<\\/p> <p>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters\\u2019 voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.<\\/p> <p>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare\\u2014the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter\\u2019s wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too\\u2014he could not meet Amy Lawrence\\u2019s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next moment he was \\u201cshowing off\\u201d with all his might\\u2014cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces\\u2014in a word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy\\u2014the memory of his humiliation in this angel\\u2019s garden\\u2014and that record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.<\\/p> <p>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters\\u2019 speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage\\u2014no less a one than the county judge\\u2014altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon\\u2014and they wondered what kind of material he was made of\\u2014and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away\\u2014so he had travelled, and seen the world\\u2014these very eyes had looked upon the county court-house\\u2014which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook at him, Jim! He\\u2019s a going up there. Say\\u2014look! he\\u2019s a going to shake hands with him\\u2014he <i>is<\\/i> shaking hands with him! By jings, don\\u2019t you wish you was Jeff?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Mr. Walters fell to \\u201cshowing off,\\u201d with all sorts of official bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The librarian \\u201cshowed off\\u201d\\u2014running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers \\u201cshowed off\\u201d\\u2014bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers \\u201cshowed off\\u201d with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline\\u2014and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls \\u201cshowed off\\u201d in various ways, and the little boys \\u201cshowed off\\u201d with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur\\u2014for he was \\u201cshowing off,\\u201d too.<\\/p> <p>There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters\\u2019 ecstasy complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough\\u2014he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.<\\/p> <p>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But there was no getting around it\\u2014here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one\\u2019s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy\\u2014but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.<\\/p> <p>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow\\u2019s instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises\\u2014a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.<\\/p> <p>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in her face\\u2014but he wouldn\\u2019t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went\\u2014came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her worlds\\u2014and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of all (she thought).<\\/p> <p>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath would hardly come, his heart quaked\\u2014partly because of the awful greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The Judge put his hand on Tom\\u2019s head and called him a fine little man, and asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, no, not Tom\\u2014it is\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThomas.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAh, that\\u2019s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That\\u2019s very well. But you\\u2019ve another one I daresay, and you\\u2019ll tell it to me, won\\u2019t you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,\\u201d said Walters, \\u201cand say sir. You mustn\\u2019t forget your manners.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThomas Sawyer\\u2014sir.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img051\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> "}';
