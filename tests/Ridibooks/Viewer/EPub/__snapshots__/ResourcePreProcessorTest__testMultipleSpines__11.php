Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.<\\/p> <p>Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img225\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"29-225.jpg (23K)\\" src=\\"\\/d9ba2c18c80ca2f972008a4618592463908ea97b.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c30\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00035\\">CHAPTER XXX<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img226\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"30-226.jpg (183K)\\" src=\\"\\/377658dc90cf166cccfb476e1619076ee7cbdf73.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman\\u2019s door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s there!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck\\u2019s scared voice answered in a low tone:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPlease let me in! It\\u2019s only Huck Finn!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!\\u2014and welcome!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>These were strange words to the vagabond boy\\u2019s ears, and the pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, my boy, I hope you\\u2019re good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun\\u2019s up, and we\\u2019ll have a piping hot one, too\\u2014make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you\\u2019d turn up and stop here last night.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI was awful scared,\\u201d said Huck, \\u201cand I run. I took out when the pistols went off, and I didn\\u2019t stop for three mile. I\\u2019ve come now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn\\u2019t want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, poor chap, you do look as if you\\u2019d had a hard night of it\\u2014but there\\u2019s a bed here for you when you\\u2019ve had your breakfast. No, they ain\\u2019t dead, lad\\u2014we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them\\u2014dark as a cellar that sumach path was\\u2014and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use\\u2014\\u2019twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, \\u2018Fire boys!\\u2019 and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn\\u2019t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals\\u2014\\u2019twould help a good deal. But you couldn\\u2019t see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img227\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"30-227.jpg (48K)\\" src=\\"\\/1127f3f66324f39b8674ff70902676ca29a4e19a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSplendid!

Off with you, boys, and tell the sheriff\\u2014get your breakfast tomorrow morning!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The Welshman\\u2019s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck sprang up and exclaimed:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, please don\\u2019t tell <i>any<\\/i>body it was me that blowed on them! Oh, please!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAll right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh no, no! Please don\\u2019t tell!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThey won\\u2019t tell\\u2014and I won\\u2019t. But why don\\u2019t you want it known?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world\\u2014he would be killed for knowing it, sure.<\\/p> <p>The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHow did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, you see, I\\u2019m a kind of a hard lot,\\u2014least everybody says so, and I don\\u2019t see nothing agin it\\u2014and sometimes I can\\u2019t sleep much, on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn\\u2019t sleep, and so I come along upstreet \\u2019bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their arm, and I reckoned they\\u2019d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t\\u2019other one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t\\u2019other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCould you see the rags by the light of the cigars?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img229\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"30-229.jpg (55K)\\" src=\\"\\/e8018651b053afdb8dca50f9c8d584290bbf393e.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know\\u2014but somehow it seems as if I did.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThen they went on, and you\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cFollered \\u2019em\\u2014yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up\\u2014they sneaked along so. I dogged \\u2019em to the widder\\u2019s stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he\\u2019d spile her looks just as I told you and your two\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat! The <i>deaf and dumb<\\/i> man said all that!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man\\u2019s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMy boy, don\\u2019t be afraid of me. I wouldn\\u2019t hurt a hair of your head for all the world. No\\u2014I\\u2019d protect you\\u2014I\\u2019d protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you\\u2019ve let that slip without intending it; you can\\u2019t cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me\\u2014tell me what it is, and trust me\\u2014I won\\u2019t betray you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck looked into the old man\\u2019s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and whispered in his ear:<\\/p> <p>\\u201c\\u2019Tain\\u2019t a Spaniard\\u2014it\\u2019s Injun Joe!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don\\u2019t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That\\u2019s a different matter altogether.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOf <i>what<\\/i>?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from Huck\\u2019s blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide, now, and his breath suspended\\u2014waiting for the answer. The Welshman started\\u2014stared in return\\u2014three seconds\\u2014five seconds\\u2014ten\\u2014then replied:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOf burglar\\u2019s tools. Why, what\\u2019s the <i>matter<\\/i> with you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously\\u2014and presently said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, burglar\\u2019s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did give you that turn? What were <i>you<\\/i> expecting we\\u2019d found?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck was in a close place\\u2014the inquiring eye was upon him\\u2014he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer\\u2014nothing suggested itself\\u2014the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper\\u2014a senseless reply offered\\u2014there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it\\u2014feebly:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSunday-school books, maybe.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man\\u2019s pocket, because it cut down the doctor\\u2019s bill like everything. Then he added:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPoor old chap, you\\u2019re white and jaded\\u2014you ain\\u2019t well a bit\\u2014no wonder you\\u2019re a little flighty and off your balance. But you\\u2019ll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow\\u2019s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however\\u2014he had not known that it wasn\\u2019t\\u2014and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not <i>the<\\/i> bundle, and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.<\\/p> <p>Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill\\u2014to stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors. The widow\\u2019s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t say a word about it, madam. There\\u2019s another that you\\u2019re more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don\\u2019t allow me to tell his name. We wouldn\\u2019t have been there but for him.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter\\u2014but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why didn\\u2019t you come and wake me?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWe judged it warn\\u2019t worth while. Those fellows warn\\u2019t likely to come again\\u2014they hadn\\u2019t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night. They\\u2019ve just come back.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.<\\/p> <p>There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher\\u2019s wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIs my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to death.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYour Becky?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d with a startled look\\u2014\\u201cdidn\\u2019t she stay with you last night?\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img232\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"30-232.jpg (59K)\\" src=\\"\\/c0f49b120d9acffa5655ff136fa397f4e5c13aa6.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, no.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGoodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I\\u2019ve got a boy that\\u2019s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night\\u2014one of you. And now he\\u2019s afraid to come to church. I\\u2019ve got to settle with him.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t stay with us,\\u201d said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly\\u2019s face.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cJoe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2019m.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhen did you see him last?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.<\\/p> <p>The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img233\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"30-233.jpg (93K)\\" src=\\"\\/d4a7ba1b7dfe974a969eb0496005050f95628c7d.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, \\u201cSend more candles\\u2014and send food.\\u201d Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.<\\/p> <p>The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord\\u2019s, and nothing that was the Lord\\u2019s was a thing to be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou can depend on it. That\\u2019s the Lord\\u2019s mark. He don\\u2019t leave it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names \\u201cBECKY &amp; TOM\\u201d had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle\\u2014and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher\\u2019s light.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img234\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"30-234.jpg (53K)\\" src=\\"\\/b128900318b93c9bdd94c41454bb30eedc348240.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked\\u2014dimly dreading the worst\\u2014if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d said the widow.<\\/p> <p>Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat?

Ah, there ain\\u2019t many left, now, that\\u2019s got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c31\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00036\\">CHAPTER XXXI<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img236\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"31-236.jpg (200K)\\" src=\\"\\/6326c82f414f87eba35b7b9dc291480afca8046a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>NOW to return to Tom and Becky\\u2019s share in the picnic. They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the cave\\u2014wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as \\u201cThe Drawing-Room,\\u201d \\u201cThe Cathedral,\\u201d \\u201cAladdin\\u2019s Palace,\\u201d and so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky\\u2019s gratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img237\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"31-237.jpg (66K)\\" src=\\"\\/f1b4b8e1cdd80f4589d3d5ddbc204b791ea50690.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man\\u2019s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky\\u2019s hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky\\u2019s light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, I didn\\u2019t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img238\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"31-238.jpg (106K)\\" src=\\"\\/7d175df3dba9a910db184c668d9dc9c912d5ac9f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cCome to think, Becky, we are away down below them\\u2014and I don\\u2019t know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn\\u2019t hear them here.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Becky grew apprehensive.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI wonder how long we\\u2019ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, I reckon we better. P\\u2019raps we better.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCan you find the way, Tom? It\\u2019s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI reckon I could find it\\u2014but then the bats. If they put our candles out it will be an awful fix. Let\\u2019s try some other way, so as not to go through there.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell. But I hope we won\\u2019t get lost. It would be so awful!\\u201d and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.<\\/p> <p>They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, it\\u2019s all right. This ain\\u2019t the one, but we\\u2019ll come to it right away!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was \\u201call right,\\u201d but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, \\u201cAll is lost!\\u201d Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last she said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Tom, never mind the bats, let\\u2019s go back that way! We seem to get worse and worse off all the time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cListen!\\u201d said he.<\\/p> <p>Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, don\\u2019t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,\\u201d said Becky.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,\\u201d and he shouted again.<\\/p> <p>The \\u201cmight\\u201d was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky\\u2014he could not find his way back!<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Tom, you didn\\u2019t make any marks!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come back! No\\u2014I can\\u2019t find the way. It\\u2019s all mixed up.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, Tom, we\\u2019re lost! we\\u2019re lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh, why <i>did<\\/i> we ever leave the others!\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img240\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"31-240.jpg (50K)\\" src=\\"\\/363516d26837ad290e0b1637249205ac2b261247.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she said.<\\/p> <p>So they moved on again\\u2014aimlessly\\u2014simply at random\\u2014all they could do was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of reviving\\u2014not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure.<\\/p> <p>By-and-by Tom took Becky\\u2019s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets\\u2014yet he must economize.<\\/p> <p>By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.<\\/p> <p>At last Becky\\u2019s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh\\u2014but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, how <i>could<\\/i> I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don\\u2019t, Tom! Don\\u2019t look so! I won\\u2019t say it again.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019m glad you\\u2019ve slept, Becky; you\\u2019ll feel rested, now, and we\\u2019ll find the way out.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWe can try, Tom; but I\\u2019ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I reckon we are going there.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMaybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let\\u2019s go on trying.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this\\u2014they could not tell how long\\u2014Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water\\u2014they must find a spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the silence:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, I am so hungry!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom took something out of his pocket.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img242\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"31-242.jpg (57K)\\" src=\\"\\/afc1e7b7ff9ea7a1d03a03e690e27764b6794ae0.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cDo you remember this?\\u201d said he.<\\/p> <p>Becky almost smiled.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s our wedding-cake, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2014I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it\\u2019s all we\\u2019ve got.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup people do with wedding-cake\\u2014but it\\u2019ll be our\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecky, can you bear it if I tell you something?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Becky\\u2019s face paled, but she thought she could.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there\\u2019s water to drink. That little piece is our last candle!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, Becky?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ll miss us and hunt for us!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, they will! Certainly they will!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMaybe they\\u2019re hunting for us now, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhen would they miss us, Tom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhen they get back to the boat, I reckon.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, it might be dark then\\u2014would they notice we hadn\\u2019t come?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got home.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>A frightened look in Becky\\u2019s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night! The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also\\u2014that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper\\u2019s.<\\/p> <p>The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then\\u2014the horror of utter darkness reigned!<\\/p> <p>How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in Tom\\u2019s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday, now\\u2014maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more.<\\/p> <p>The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A portion of Tom\\u2019s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted desire.<\\/p> <p>By-and-by Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSH! Did you hear that?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s them!\\u201d said Tom; \\u201cthey\\u2019re coming! Come along, Becky\\u2014we\\u2019re all right now!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred\\u2014there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.<\\/p> <p>The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.<\\/p> <p>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a \\u201cjumping-off place.\\u201d Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to\\u2014Injun Joe\\u2019s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the \\u201cSpaniard\\u201d take to his heels and get himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom\\u2019s fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted \\u201cfor luck.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img245\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"31-245.jpg (106K)\\" src=\\"\\/10bd69b77494adcd7ddff39f1cb0e32bde394571.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run. Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die\\u2014it would not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.<\\/p> <p>Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c32\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00037\\">CHAPTER XXXII<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img247\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"32-247.jpg (193K)\\" src=\\"\\/33eefb4ec653e5e58ea4328d44b119bb5bbe1e08.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner\\u2019s whole heart in it; but still no good news came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.<\\/p> <p>Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who shouted, \\u201cTurn out! turn out! they\\u2019re found! they\\u2019re found!\\u201d Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah!<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img248\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> "}';
