Presently they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGet away from here!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGo away yourself!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t either.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a coward and a pup. I\\u2019ll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I\\u2019ll make him do it, too.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat do I care for your big brother? I\\u2019ve got a brother that\\u2019s bigger than he is\\u2014and what\\u2019s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\\u201d [Both brothers were imaginary.]<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a lie.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Your<\\/i> saying so don\\u2019t make it so.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI dare you to step over that, and I\\u2019ll lick you till you can\\u2019t stand up. Anybody that\\u2019ll take a dare will steal sheep.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow you said you\\u2019d do it, now let\\u2019s see you do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t you crowd me now; you better look out.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, you <i>said<\\/i> you\\u2019d do it\\u2014why don\\u2019t you do it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBy jingo! for two cents I <i>will<\\/i> do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other\\u2019s hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other\\u2019s nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. \\u201cHoller \\u2019nuff!\\u201d said he.<\\/p> <p>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying\\u2014mainly from rage.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHoller \\u2019nuff!\\u201d\\u2014and the pounding went on.<\\/p> <p>At last the stranger got out a smothered \\u201c\\u2019Nuff!\\u201d and Tom let him up and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow that\\u2019ll learn you. Better look out who you\\u2019re fooling with next time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the \\u201cnext time he caught him out.\\u201d To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At last the enemy\\u2019s mothe...<\\/p>"}';
