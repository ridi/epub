Tom tried again, with soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was up, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her face to the wall. Tom\\u2019s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a moment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecky, I\\u2014I don\\u2019t care for anybody but you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>No reply\\u2014but sobs.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecky\\u201d\\u2014pleadingly. \\u201cBecky, won\\u2019t you say something?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>More sobs.<\\/p> <p>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPlease, Becky, won\\u2019t you take it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom! Come back, Tom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img078\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"07-078.jpg (53K)\\" src=\\"\\/3b95f26ac620633079907b76132f17d9db60a601.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c8\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00012\\">CHAPTER VIII<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img079\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"08-079.jpg (195K)\\" src=\\"\\/f326d45749dcbad5fb5f234aa1d20c7a284c3c3d.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed a small \\u201cbranch\\u201d two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy\\u2019s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant the best in the world, and been treated like a dog\\u2014like a very dog. She would be sorry some day\\u2014maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only die <i>temporarily<\\/i>!<\\/p> <p>But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away\\u2014ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas\\u2014and never came back any more! How would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious. No\\u2014better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it! <i>now<\\/i> his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder! How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, \\u201cIt\\u2019s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!\\u2014the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img081\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"08-081.jpg (99K)\\" src=\\"\\/5185e8eacc10524e26d7cb6b95f996e84be196b5.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together. He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat hasn\\u2019t come here, come! What\\u2019s here, stay here!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom\\u2019s astonishment was bound-less! He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, that beats anything!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed. Tom\\u2019s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDoodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHe dasn\\u2019t tell! So it <i>was<\\/i> a witch that done it. I just knowed it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBrother, go find your brother!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each other.<\\/p> <p>Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way and that. He said cautiously\\u2014to an imaginary company:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom called:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img083\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"08-083.jpg (58K)\\" src=\\"\\/49af495e58adfd81178d84b8966eb7e9dcfb8d9f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cGuy of Guisborne wants no man\\u2019s pass.

Have at thee!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, \\u201ctwo up and two down.\\u201d Presently Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, if you\\u2019ve got the hang, go it lively!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So they \\u201cwent it lively,\\u201d panting and perspiring with the work. By and by Tom shouted:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cFall! fall! Why don\\u2019t you fall?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI sha\\u2019n\\u2019t! Why don\\u2019t you fall yourself? You\\u2019re getting the worst of it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, that ain\\u2019t anything. I can\\u2019t fall; that ain\\u2019t the way it is in the book. The book says, \\u2018Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.\\u2019 You\\u2019re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack and fell.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow,\\u201d said Joe, getting up, \\u201cyou got to let me kill <i>you<\\/i>. That\\u2019s fair.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, I can\\u2019t do that, it ain\\u2019t in the book.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, it\\u2019s blamed mean\\u2014that\\u2019s all.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller\\u2019s son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I\\u2019ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, \\u201cWhere this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.\\u201d Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img084\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"08-084.jpg (49K)\\" src=\\"\\/ca104dd9b2aab84a1733a80cadbbe958108fe441.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.

They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly\\u2019s chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the bed\\u2019s head made Tom shudder\\u2014it meant that somebody\\u2019s days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of \\u201cScat! you devil!\\u201d and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt\\u2019s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the \\u201cell\\u201d on all fours. He \\u201cmeow\\u2019d\\u201d with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img086\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"09-086.jpg (52K)\\" src=\\"\\/89139b11619328052b25e47d42033ddbbe980252.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. \\u201cSacred to the memory of\\u201d So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.<\\/p> <p>A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.<\\/p> <p>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom\\u2019s reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a whisper:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huckleberry whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI wisht I knowed. It\\u2019s awful solemn like, <i>ain\\u2019t<\\/i> it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI bet it is.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Hucky\\u2014do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cO\\u2019 course he does.

A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook! See there!\\u201d whispered Tom. \\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s the devils sure enough. Three of \\u2019em! Lordy, Tom, we\\u2019re goners!

They cast down their load and began to open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the boys could have touched him.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHurry, men!\\u201d he said, in a low voice; \\u201cthe moon might come out at any moment.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow the cussed thing\\u2019s ready, Sawbones, and you\\u2019ll just out with another five, or here she stays.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s the talk!\\u201d said Injun Joe.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook here, what does this mean?\\u201d said the doctor. \\u201cYou required your pay in advance, and I\\u2019ve paid you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, and you done more than that,\\u201d said Injun Joe, approaching the doctor, who was now standing. \\u201cFive years ago you drove me away from your father\\u2019s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn\\u2019t there for any good; and when I swore I\\u2019d get even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I\\u2019d forget? The Injun blood ain\\u2019t in me for nothing. And now I\\u2019ve <i>got<\\/i> you, and you got to <i>settle<\\/i>, you know!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHere, now, don\\u2019t you hit my pard!\\u201d and the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter\\u2019s knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams\\u2019 grave and felled Potter to the earth with it\\u2014and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man\\u2019s breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.<\\/p> <p>Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>That<\\/i> score is settled\\u2014damn you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter\\u2019s open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three\\u2014four\\u2014five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe\\u2019s.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLord, how is this, Joe?\\u201d he said.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a dirty business,\\u201d said Joe, without moving.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat did you do it for?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI! I never done it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook here! That kind of talk won\\u2019t wash.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Potter trembled and grew white.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI thought I\\u2019d got sober. I\\u2019d no business to drink to-night. But it\\u2019s in my head yet\\u2014worse\\u2019n when we started here. I\\u2019m all in a muddle; can\\u2019t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe\\u2014<i>honest<\\/i>, now, old feller\\u2014did I do it? Joe, I never meant to\\u2014\\u2019pon my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it\\u2019s awful\\u2014and him so young and promising.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip\\u2014and here you\\u2019ve laid, as dead as a wedge til now.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img091\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"09-091.jpg (101K)\\" src=\\"\\/d042845098d19c6feddc08e3ebac74d7893f05ae.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, I didn\\u2019t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I\\u2019ve fought, but never with weepons. They\\u2019ll all say that. Joe, don\\u2019t tell! Say you won\\u2019t tell, Joe\\u2014that\\u2019s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don\\u2019t you remember? You <i>won\\u2019t<\\/i> tell, <i>will<\\/i> you, Joe?\\u201d And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and clasped his appealing hands.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, you\\u2019ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won\\u2019t go back on you. There, now, that\\u2019s as fair as a man can say.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Joe, you\\u2019re an angel. I\\u2019ll bless you for this the longest day I live.\\u201d And Potter began to cry.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCome, now, that\\u2019s enough of that. This ain\\u2019t any time for blubbering. You be off yonder way and I\\u2019ll go this. Move, now, and don\\u2019t leave any tracks behind you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIf he\\u2019s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being, he won\\u2019t think of the knife till he\\u2019s gone so far he\\u2019ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself\\u2014chicken-heart!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon\\u2019s. The stillness was complete again, too.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img092\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"09-092.jpg (45K)\\" src=\\"\\/dc514b0c0e634db2fb9dc7d4c8a87a13e6ec89c0.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c10\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00014\\">CHAPTER X<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img093\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"10-093.jpg (171K)\\" src=\\"\\/f318739153435d8f942b71196812f8390a7e5c57.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIf we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!\\u201d whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. \\u201cI can\\u2019t stand it much longer.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huckleberry\\u2019s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it. They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuckleberry, what do you reckon\\u2019ll come of this?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIf Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging\\u2019ll come of it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDo you though?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, I <i>know<\\/i> it, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom thought a while, then he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho\\u2019ll tell? We?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat are you talking about? S\\u2019pose something happened and Injun Joe <i>didn\\u2019t<\\/i> hang? Why, he\\u2019d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we\\u2019re a laying here.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIf anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he\\u2019s fool enough. He\\u2019s generally drunk enough.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom said nothing\\u2014went on thinking. Presently he whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, Muff Potter don\\u2019t know it. How can he tell?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the reason he don\\u2019t know it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecause he\\u2019d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D\\u2019you reckon he could see anything? D\\u2019you reckon he knowed anything?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBy hokey, that\\u2019s so, Tom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd besides, look-a-here\\u2014maybe that whack done for <i>him<\\/i>!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, \\u2019taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, he always has. Well, when pap\\u2019s full, you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn\\u2019t phase him. He says so, his own self. So it\\u2019s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>After another reflective silence, Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHucky, you sure you can keep mum?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, we <i>got<\\/i> to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn\\u2019t make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak \\u2019bout this and they didn\\u2019t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another\\u2014that\\u2019s what we got to do\\u2014swear to keep mum.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img095\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"10-095.jpg (149K)\\" src=\\"\\/57a22e4034f4b5ec2c3f8cdfc6951537b410e654.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019m agreed. It\\u2019s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear that we\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh no, that wouldn\\u2019t do for this. That\\u2019s good enough for little rubbishy common things\\u2014specially with gals, cuz <i>they<\\/i> go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff\\u2014but there orter be writing \\u2019bout a big thing like this. And blood.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom\\u2019s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a little fragment of \\u201cred keel\\u201d out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom\\u2019s facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHold on! Don\\u2019t do that. A pin\\u2019s brass. It might have verdigrease on it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s verdigrease?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s p\\u2019ison. That\\u2019s what it is. You just swaller some of it once\\u2014you\\u2019ll see.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away.<\\/p> <p>A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom,\\u201d whispered Huckleberry, \\u201cdoes this keep us from <i>ever<\\/i> telling\\u2014<i>always<\\/i>?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOf course it does. It don\\u2019t make any difference <i>what<\\/i> happens, we got to keep mum. We\\u2019d drop down dead\\u2014don\\u2019t <i>you<\\/i> know that?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, I reckon that\\u2019s so.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside\\u2014within ten feet of them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhich of us does he mean?\\u201d gasped Huckleberry.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI dono\\u2014peep through the crack. Quick!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, <i>you<\\/i>, Tom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t\\u2014I can\\u2019t <i>do<\\/i> it, Huck!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPlease, Tom.

His whisper was hardly audible when he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Huck, <i>its a stray dog<\\/i>!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cQuick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, he must mean us both\\u2014we\\u2019re right together.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Tom, I reckon we\\u2019re goners.

This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller\\u2019s told <i>not<\\/i> to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I\\u2019d a tried\\u2014but no, I wouldn\\u2019t, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay I\\u2019ll just <i>waller<\\/i> in Sunday-schools!\\u201d And Tom began to snuffle a little.<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>You<\\/i> bad!\\u201d and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. \\u201cConsound it, Tom Sawyer, you\\u2019re just old pie, \\u2019long-side o\\u2019 what I am. Oh, <i>lordy<\\/i>, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom choked off and whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook, Hucky, look! He\\u2019s got his <i>back<\\/i> to us!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you know. <i>Now<\\/i> who can he mean?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSh! What\\u2019s that?\\u201d he whispered.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSounds like\\u2014like hogs grunting. No\\u2014it\\u2019s somebody snoring, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat <i>is<\\/i> it! Where \\u2019bouts is it, Huck?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI bleeve it\\u2019s down at \\u2019tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, \\u2019long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when <i>he<\\/i> snores. Besides, I reckon he ain\\u2019t ever coming back to this town any more.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The spirit of adventure rose in the boys\\u2019 souls once more.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHucky, do you das\\u2019t to go if I lead?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like to, much.

But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys\\u2019 hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter was lying, and <i>facing<\\/i> Potter, with his nose pointing heavenward.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, geeminy, it\\u2019s <i>him<\\/i>!\\u201d exclaimed both boys, in a breath.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Tom\\u2014they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller\\u2019s house, \\u2019bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there ain\\u2019t anybody dead there yet.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I know that. And suppose there ain\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, but she ain\\u2019t <i>dead<\\/i>. And what\\u2019s more, she\\u2019s getting better, too.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAll right, you wait and see. She\\u2019s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff Potter\\u2019s a goner. That\\u2019s what the niggers say, and they know all about these kind of things, Huck.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.<\\/p> <p>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not been called\\u2014persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit\\u2019s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.<\\/p> <p>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom\\u2019s heart was sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img100\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> "}';
