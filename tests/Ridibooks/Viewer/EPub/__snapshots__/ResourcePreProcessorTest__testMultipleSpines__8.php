They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.<\\/p> <p>At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t say it wasn\\u2019t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering \\u2019most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn\\u2019t dead, but only run off.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, you could have done that, Tom,\\u201d said Mary; \\u201cand I believe you would if you had thought of it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWould you, Tom?\\u201d said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. \\u201cSay, now, would you, if you\\u2019d thought of it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2014well, I don\\u2019t know. \\u2019Twould \\u2019a\\u2019 spoiled everything.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, I hoped you loved me that much,\\u201d said Aunt Polly, with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy. \\u201cIt would have been something if you\\u2019d cared enough to <i>think<\\/i> of it, even if you didn\\u2019t <i>do<\\/i> it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, auntie, that ain\\u2019t any harm,\\u201d pleaded Mary; \\u201cit\\u2019s only Tom\\u2019s giddy way\\u2014he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMore\\u2019s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and <i>done<\\/i> it, too. Tom, you\\u2019ll look back, some day, when it\\u2019s too late, and wish you\\u2019d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, auntie, you know I do care for you,\\u201d said Tom.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019d know it better if you acted more like it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI wish now I\\u2019d thought,\\u201d said Tom, with a repentant tone; \\u201cbut I dreamt about you, anyway.

So we always do. I\\u2019m glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd I dreamt that Joe Harper\\u2019s mother was here.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, she was here!

Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd then you began to cry.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSo I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThen Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and she wished she hadn\\u2019t whipped him for taking cream when she\\u2019d throwed it out her own self\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom!

There <i>was<\\/i> an angel there, somewheres!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cJust as true as I live!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd then there was a whole lot of talk \\u2019bout dragging the river for us, and \\u2019bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I\\u2019m a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn\\u2019t told it more like if you\\u2019d \\u2019a\\u2019 seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThen I thought you prayed for me\\u2014and I could see you and hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, \\u2018We ain\\u2019t dead\\u2014we are only off being pirates,\\u2019 and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDid you, Tom, <i>did<\\/i> you! I just forgive you everything for that!\\u201d And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt was very kind, even though it was only a\\u2014dream,\\u201d Sid soliloquized just audibly.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cShut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he\\u2019d do if he was awake. Here\\u2019s a big Milum apple I\\u2019ve been saving for you, Tom, if you was ever found again\\u2014now go \\u2019long to school. I\\u2019m thankful to the good God and Father of us all I\\u2019ve got you back, that\\u2019s long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I\\u2019m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there\\u2019s few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes. Go \\u2019long Sid, Mary, Tom\\u2014take yourselves off\\u2014you\\u2019ve hendered me long enough.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper and vanquish her realism with Tom\\u2019s marvellous dream. Sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house. It was this: \\u201cPretty thin\\u2014as long a dream as that, without any mistakes in it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing, but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a circus.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img152\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"18-152.jpg (59K)\\" src=\\"\\/e2d8bec246e720989f515b02513c7b2b539f59fe.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not long in becoming insufferably \\u201cstuck-up.\\u201d They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners\\u2014but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.<\\/p> <p>Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to \\u201cmake up.\\u201d Well, let her\\u2014she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only \\u201cset him up\\u201d the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom\\u2019s elbow\\u2014with sham vivacity:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn\\u2019t you come to Sunday-school?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI did come\\u2014didn\\u2019t you see me?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, no! Did you? Where did you sit?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI was in Miss Peters\\u2019 class, where I always go. I saw <i>you<\\/i>.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDid you? Why, it\\u2019s funny I didn\\u2019t see you. I wanted to tell you about the picnic.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, that\\u2019s jolly. Who\\u2019s going to give it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMy ma\\u2019s going to let me have one.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, goody; I hope she\\u2019ll let <i>me<\\/i> come.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, she will. The picnic\\u2019s for me. She\\u2019ll let anybody come that I want, and I want you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s ever so nice. When is it going to be?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBy and by. Maybe about vacation.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, won\\u2019t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, every one that\\u2019s friends to me\\u2014or wants to be\\u201d; and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree \\u201call to flinders\\u201d while he was \\u201cstanding within three feet of it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, may I come?\\u201d said Grace Miller.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd me?\\u201d said Sally Rogers.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd me, too?\\u201d said Susy Harper. \\u201cAnd Joe?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky\\u2019s lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call \\u201ca good cry.\\u201d Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what <i>she\\u2019d<\\/i> do.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img154\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"18-154.jpg (54K)\\" src=\\"\\/e559cf1f91ebac8e07ae0a3bbddb576368e87b19.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple\\u2014and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides. Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom\\u2019s veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom\\u2019s tongue had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img155\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"18-155.jpg (57K)\\" src=\\"\\/c156f51be57c1cfa7096297d6db961d626324309.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Amy\\u2019s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain\\u2014the girl chirped on. Tom thought, \\u201cOh, hang her, ain\\u2019t I ever going to get rid of her?\\u201d At last he must be attending to those things\\u2014and she said artlessly that she would be \\u201caround\\u201d when school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img156\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"18-156.jpg (47K)\\" src=\\"\\/6a42ef2c7077d56490400d6640e7ce36904df2d5.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cAny other boy!\\u201d Tom thought, grating his teeth. \\u201cAny boy in the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this town, mister, and I\\u2019ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you out! I\\u2019ll just take and\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy\\u2014pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. \\u201cOh, you do, do you? You holler \\u2019nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!\\u201d And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.<\\/p> <p>Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy\\u2019s grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn\\u2019t carried it so far. When poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept exclaiming: \\u201cOh, here\\u2019s a jolly one! look at this!\\u201d she lost patience at last, and said, \\u201cOh, don\\u2019t bother me! I don\\u2019t care for them!\\u201d and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.<\\/p> <p>Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGo away and leave me alone, can\\u2019t you! I hate you!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done\\u2014for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning\\u2014and she walked on, crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth\\u2014the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him. He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself. Tom\\u2019s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img157\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"18-157.jpg (54K)\\" src=\\"\\/9021152be21dff0ad97e1e6e1094ec951a97c4e9.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act, and moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now, intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she had changed her mind. The thought of Tom\\u2019s treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book\\u2019s account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c19\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00023\\">CHAPTER XIX<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img158\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"19-158.jpg (168K)\\" src=\\"\\/32a4ce06ac11549e456a824fe1a8c8ebcdf8b030.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, I\\u2019ve a notion to skin you alive!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAuntie, what have I done?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, expecting I\\u2019m going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she\\u2019d found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don\\u2019t know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAuntie, I wish I hadn\\u2019t done it\\u2014but I didn\\u2019t think.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson\\u2019s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn\\u2019t ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAuntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn\\u2019t mean to be mean. I didn\\u2019t, honest. And besides, I didn\\u2019t come over here to laugh at you that night.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat did you come for, then?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn\\u2019t got drownded.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never did\\u2014and I know it, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIndeed and \\u2019deed I did, auntie\\u2014I wish I may never stir if I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Tom, don\\u2019t lie\\u2014don\\u2019t do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt ain\\u2019t a lie, auntie; it\\u2019s the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving\\u2014that was all that made me come.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019d give the whole world to believe that\\u2014it would cover up a power of sins, Tom. I\\u2019d \\u2019most be glad you\\u2019d run off and acted so bad. But it ain\\u2019t reasonable; because, why didn\\u2019t you tell me, child?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn\\u2019t somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat bark?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThe bark I had wrote on to tell you we\\u2019d gone pirating. I wish, now, you\\u2019d waked up when I kissed you\\u2014I do, honest.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The hard lines in his aunt\\u2019s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes.<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Did<\\/i> you kiss me, Tom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, yes, I did.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAre you sure you did, Tom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, yes, I did, auntie\\u2014certain sure.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat did you kiss me for, Tom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecause I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cKiss me again, Tom!\\u2014and be off with you to school, now, and don\\u2019t bother me any more.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her hand, and said to herself:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he\\u2019s lied about it\\u2014but it\\u2019s a blessed, blessed lie, there\\u2019s such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord\\u2014I <i>know<\\/i> the Lord will forgive him, because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don\\u2019t want to find out it\\u2019s a lie. I won\\u2019t look.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a good lie\\u2014it\\u2019s a good lie\\u2014I won\\u2019t let it grieve me.\\u201d So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom\\u2019s piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: \\u201cI could forgive the boy, now, if he\\u2019d committed a million sins!\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img160\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"19-160.jpg (63K)\\" src=\\"\\/1ad8bfe441b77e6c98aa23934f01eb46d9e9a67a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c20\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00024\\">CHAPTER XX<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img161\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"20-161.jpg (178K)\\" src=\\"\\/ad49f8cb804e63986258a2a58da35b0118691de7.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>THERE was something about Aunt Polly\\u2019s manner, when she kissed Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a moment\\u2019s hesitation he ran to her and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I\\u2019m so sorry. I won\\u2019t ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live\\u2014please make up, won\\u2019t you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll thank you to keep yourself <i>to<\\/i> yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I\\u2019ll never speak to you again.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say \\u201cWho cares, Miss Smarty?\\u201d until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to \\u201ctake in,\\u201d she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom\\u2019s offensive fling had driven it entirely away.<\\/p> <p>Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself. The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the book in her hands. The titlepage\\u2014Professor Somebody\\u2019s <i>Anatomy<\\/i>\\u2014carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece\\u2014a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person and look at what they\\u2019re looking at.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img163\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"20-163.jpg (54K)\\" src=\\"\\/0b4e2fca658ce0726f484506620c0d1379ed662f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cHow could I know you was looking at anything?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you\\u2019re going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I\\u2019ll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then she stamped her little foot and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Be<\\/i> so mean if you want to! I know something that\\u2019s going to happen. You just wait and you\\u2019ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!\\u201d\\u2014and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.<\\/p> <p>Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said to himself:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school! Shucks! What\\u2019s a licking! That\\u2019s just like a girl\\u2014they\\u2019re so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain\\u2019t going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because there\\u2019s other ways of getting even on her, that ain\\u2019t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book. Nobody\\u2019ll answer. Then he\\u2019ll do just the way he always does\\u2014ask first one and then t\\u2019other, and when he comes to the right girl he\\u2019ll know it, without any telling. Girls\\u2019 faces always tell on them. They ain\\u2019t got any backbone. She\\u2019ll get licked. Well, it\\u2019s a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain\\u2019t any way out of it.\\u201d Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: \\u201cAll right, though; she\\u2019d like to see me in just such a fix\\u2014let her sweat it out!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the master arrived and school \\u201ctook in.\\u201d Tom did not feel a strong interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls\\u2019 side of the room Becky\\u2019s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom\\u2019s mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still\\u2014because, said she to herself, \\u201che\\u2019ll tell about me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn\\u2019t say a word, not to save his life!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout\\u2014he had denied it for form\\u2019s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from principle.<\\/p> <p>A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her. Quick\\u2014something must be done! done in a flash, too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good!\\u2014he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was lost\\u2014the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten\\u2014the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: \\u201cWho tore this book?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBenjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>A denial. Another pause.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cJoseph Harper, did you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Another denial. Tom\\u2019s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of boys\\u2014considered a while, then turned to the girls:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAmy Lawrence?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>A shake of the head.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGracie Miller?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The same sign.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSusan Harper, did you do this?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cRebecca Thatcher\\u201d [Tom glanced at her face\\u2014it was white with terror]\\u2014\\u201cdid you tear\\u2014no, look me in the face\\u201d [her hands rose in appeal]\\u2014\\u201cdid you tear this book?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>A thought shot like lightning through Tom\\u2019s brain. He sprang to his feet and shouted\\u2014\\u201cI done it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img165\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"20-165.jpg (54K)\\" src=\\"\\/f336bfaf773cb9030ee2e2b8e29c914e334a5e0a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky\\u2019s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed\\u2014for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.<\\/p> <p>Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky\\u2019s latest words lingering dreamily in his ear\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, how <i>could<\\/i> you be so noble!\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img166\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"20-166.jpg (28K)\\" src=\\"\\/226536424128f51aa6d1603792b8fbf76f8cee6d.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c21\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00025\\">CHAPTER XXI<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img167\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"21-167.jpg (178K)\\" src=\\"\\/88dfd92a23ed6d5eb1fead6e5715148824b7fa2a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on \\u201cExamination\\u201d day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now\\u2014at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins\\u2019 lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the signpainter\\u2019s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father\\u2019s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master\\u2019s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the signpainter\\u2019s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would \\u201cmanage the thing\\u201d while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.<\\/p> <p>In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers\\u2019 ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img168\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"21-168.jpg (103K)\\" src=\\"\\/75c5f50d57ce092b31feeb6f92cb54ef1d894861.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, \\u201cYou\\u2019d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,\\u201d etc.\\u2014accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used\\u2014supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.<\\/p> <p>A little shamefaced girl lisped, \\u201cMary had a little lamb,\\u201d etc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed and happy.<\\/p> <p>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible \\u201cGive me liberty or give me death\\u201d speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house\\u2019s silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThe Boy Stood on the Burning Deck\\u201d followed; also \\u201cThe Assyrian Came Down,\\u201d and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now\\u2014original \\u201ccompositions\\u201d by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to \\u201cexpression\\u201d and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. \\u201cFriendship\\u201d was one; \\u201cMemories of Other Days\\u201d; \\u201cReligion in History\\u201d; \\u201cDream Land\\u201d; \\u201cThe Advantages of Culture\\u201d; \\u201cForms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted\\u201d; \\u201cMelancholy\\u201d; \\u201cFilial Love\\u201d; \\u201cHeart Longings,\\u201d etc., etc.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img170\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> "}';
