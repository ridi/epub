occurred; one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual\\u2014he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.<\\/p> <p>The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story\\u2014that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.<\\/p> <p>Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.<\\/p> <p>THE AUTHOR.<\\/p> <p>HARTFORD, 1876.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c1\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00005\\">CHAPTER I<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img017\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"01-017.jpg (182K)\\" src=\\"\\/758ea2eaa0f20b522ccf10dde0b58eae7e41d0fd.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cTOM!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>No answer.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTOM!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>No answer.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s gone with that boy, \\u00a0I wonder? You TOM!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>No answer.<\\/p> <p>The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked <i>through<\\/i> them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \\u201cstyle,\\u201d not service\\u2014she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I lay if I get hold of you I\\u2019ll\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI never did see the beat of that boy!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and \\u201cjimpson\\u201d weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cY-o-u-u TOM!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThere! I might \\u2019a\\u2019 thought of that closet. What you been doing in there?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNothing.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What <i>is<\\/i> that truck?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, aunt.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I know. It\\u2019s jam\\u2014that\\u2019s what it is. Forty times I\\u2019ve said if you didn\\u2019t let that jam alone I\\u2019d skin you. Hand me that switch.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The switch hovered in the air\\u2014the peril was desperate\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMy! Look behind you, aunt!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared over it.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img018\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"01-018.jpg (54K)\\" src=\\"\\/fb90aed1da70495e5bd66f27084d125fb1a7ada8.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHang the boy, can\\u2019t I never learn anything? Ain\\u2019t he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can\\u2019t learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what\\u2019s coming? He \\u2019pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it\\u2019s all down again and I can\\u2019t hit him a lick. I ain\\u2019t doing my duty by that boy, and that\\u2019s the Lord\\u2019s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I\\u2019m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He\\u2019s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he\\u2019s my own dead sister\\u2019s boy, poor thing, and I ain\\u2019t got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it\\u2019s so. He\\u2019ll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for \\u201cafternoon\\u201d] I\\u2019ll just be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It\\u2019s mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I\\u2019ve <i>got<\\/i> to do some of my duty by him, or I\\u2019ll be the ruination of the child.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day\\u2019s wood and split the kindlings before supper\\u2014at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. Tom\\u2019s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img019\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"01-019.jpg (48K)\\" src=\\"\\/983ad833e60982dbc35f42c92c74fade7b666a61.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very deep\\u2014for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, it was middling warm in school, warn\\u2019t it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2019m.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPowerful warm, warn\\u2019t it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2019m.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDidn\\u2019t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>A bit of a scare shot through Tom\\u2014a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly\\u2019s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2019m\\u2014well, not very much.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom\\u2019s shirt, and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBut you ain\\u2019t too warm now, though.\\u201d And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSome of us pumped on our heads\\u2014mine\\u2019s damp yet. See?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, you didn\\u2019t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The trouble vanished out of Tom\\u2019s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt collar was securely sewed.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBother! Well, go \\u2019long with you. I\\u2019d made sure you\\u2019d played hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you\\u2019re a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is\\u2014better\\u2019n you look. <i>This<\\/i> time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.<\\/p> <p>But Sidney said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, now, if I didn\\u2019t think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it\\u2019s black.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, I did sew it with white! Tom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSiddy, I\\u2019ll lick you for that.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them\\u2014one needle carried white thread and the other black. He said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cShe\\u2019d never noticed if it hadn\\u2019t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to gee-miny she\\u2019d stick to one or t\\u2019other\\u2014I can\\u2019t keep the run of \\u2019em. But I bet you I\\u2019ll lam Sid for that. I\\u2019ll learn him!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well though\\u2014and loathed him.<\\/p> <p>Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man\\u2019s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time\\u2014just as men\\u2019s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music\\u2014the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet\\u2014no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.<\\/p> <p>The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him\\u2014a boy a shade larger than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too\\u2014well dressed on a week-day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on\\u2014and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom\\u2019s vitals. The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved\\u2014but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI can lick you!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to see you try it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I can do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo you can\\u2019t, either.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes I can.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo you can\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI can.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCan!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s your name?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201c\\u2019Tisn\\u2019t any of your business, maybe.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell I \\u2019low I\\u2019ll <i>make<\\/i> it my business.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell why don\\u2019t you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIf you say much, I will.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMuch\\u2014much\\u2014<i>much<\\/i>.
