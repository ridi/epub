That\\u2019s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two thousand verses is a great many\\u2014very, very great many. And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it\\u2019s what makes great men and good men; you\\u2019ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you\\u2019ll look back and say, It\\u2019s all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood\\u2014it\\u2019s all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn\\u2014it\\u2019s all owing to the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a beautiful Bible\\u2014a splendid elegant Bible\\u2014to keep and have it all for my own, always\\u2014it\\u2019s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will say, Thomas\\u2014and you wouldn\\u2019t take any money for those two thousand verses\\u2014no indeed you wouldn\\u2019t.

Now, no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won\\u2019t you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed, now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters\\u2019 heart sank within him. He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question\\u2014why <i>did<\\/i> the Judge ask him?

The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her\\u2014Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the mayor and his wife\\u2014for they had a mayor there, among other unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body\\u2014for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been \\u201cthrown up to them\\u201d so much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on Sundays\\u2014accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys who had as snobs.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img054\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"05-054.jpg (45K)\\" src=\\"\\/8e562afcae0c60d566c7014cfcf61b61f31fce6b.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.<\\/p> <p>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img055\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"05-055.jpg (94K)\\" src=\\"\\/b576095a6413190b6bf09af5e83edd8fa309c481.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow\\u2019ry <i>beds<\\/i> of ease,<\\/p> <p>Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro\\u2019 <i>blood<\\/i>-y seas?<\\/p> <p>He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church \\u201csociables\\u201d he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps, and \\u201cwall\\u201d their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, \\u201cWords cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a bulletin-board, and read off \\u201cnotices\\u201d of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom\\u2014a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.<\\/p> <p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen.<\\/p> <p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it\\u2014if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously\\u2014for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman\\u2019s regular route over it\\u2014and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom\\u2019s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare\\u2014he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the \\u201cAmen\\u201d was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.<\\/p> <p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\\u2014and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world\\u2019s hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img057\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"05-057.jpg (49K)\\" src=\\"\\/8da7f66dbaa0be25a64c1fc590f0a16aba81226f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed. Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws\\u2014a \\u201cpinchbug,\\u201d he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy\\u2019s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle\\u2019s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into its master\\u2019s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img058\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"05-058.jpg (50K)\\" src=\\"\\/1208430caf95ddf73efff318464ee6508eea9f67.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.<\\/p> <p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img059\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"05-059.jpg (33K)\\" src=\\"\\/f22af954d66a385554f07047e428096df8c4ce8b.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c6\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00010\\">CHAPTER VI<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img060\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"06-060.jpg (202K)\\" src=\\"\\/0fb28a917a5d5013ea9839f23f1b8820ded9e3be.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found him so\\u2014because it began another week\\u2019s slow suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.<\\/p> <p>Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a \\u201cstarter,\\u201d as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.<\\/p> <p>But Sid slept on unconscious.<\\/p> <p>Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.<\\/p> <p>No result from Sid.<\\/p> <p>Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.<\\/p> <p>Sid snored on.<\\/p> <p>Tom was aggravated. He said, \\u201cSid, Sid!\\u201d and shook him. This course worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom! Say, Tom!\\u201d [No response.] \\u201cHere, Tom! TOM! What is the matter, Tom?\\u201d And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.<\\/p> <p>Tom moaned out:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, don\\u2019t, Sid. Don\\u2019t joggle me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, what\\u2019s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo\\u2014never mind. It\\u2019ll be over by and by, maybe. Don\\u2019t call anybody.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBut I must! <i>Don\\u2019t<\\/i> groan so, Tom, it\\u2019s awful. How long you been this way?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHours. Ouch! Oh, don\\u2019t stir so, Sid, you\\u2019ll kill me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, why didn\\u2019t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, <i>don\\u2019t!<\\/i> It makes my flesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you\\u2019ve ever done to me. When I\\u2019m gone\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Tom, you ain\\u2019t dying, are you? Don\\u2019t, Tom\\u2014oh, don\\u2019t. Maybe\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell \\u2019em so, Sid. And Sid, you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that\\u2019s come to town, and tell her\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.<\\/p> <p>Sid flew downstairs and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom\\u2019s dying!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDying!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2019m. Don\\u2019t wait\\u2014come quick!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cRubbage! I don\\u2019t believe it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels. And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the bedside she gasped out:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou, Tom! Tom, what\\u2019s the matter with you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, auntie, I\\u2019m\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter with you\\u2014what is the matter with you, child?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, auntie, my sore toe\\u2019s mortified!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a little foolish, and he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAunt Polly, it <i>seemed<\\/i> mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYour tooth, indeed! What\\u2019s the matter with your tooth?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOne of them\\u2019s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThere, there, now, don\\u2019t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well\\u2014your tooth <i>is<\\/i> loose, but you\\u2019re not going to die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, please, auntie, don\\u2019t pull it out. It don\\u2019t hurt any more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don\\u2019t, auntie. I don\\u2019t want to stay home from school.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img063\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"06-063.jpg (54K)\\" src=\\"\\/ce211e56abfaff157a7685c3ab34139ec59bf778.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, you don\\u2019t, don\\u2019t you? So all this row was because you thought you\\u2019d get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.\\u201d By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom\\u2019s tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy\\u2019s face. The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost, now.<\\/p> <p>But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn\\u2019t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, \\u201cSour grapes!\\u201d and he wandered away a dismantled hero.<\\/p> <p>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad\\u2014and because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img064\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"06-064.jpg (42K)\\" src=\\"\\/642bab4e7d73ad90eea92041ad5e3c854b873a4f.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.<\\/p> <p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHello, Huckleberry!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHello yourself, and see how you like it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that you got?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDead cat.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLemme see him, Huck.

Where\\u2019d you get him?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBought him off\\u2019n a boy.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat did you give?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhere\\u2019d you get the blue ticket?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBought it off\\u2019n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay\\u2014what is dead cats good for, Huck?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGood for? Cure warts with.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo! Is that so? I know something that\\u2019s better.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI bet you don\\u2019t. What is it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, spunk-water.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSpunk-water! I wouldn\\u2019t give a dern for spunk-water.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou wouldn\\u2019t, wouldn\\u2019t you? D\\u2019you ever try it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, I hain\\u2019t. But Bob Tanner did.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWho told you so!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, what of it? They\\u2019ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I don\\u2019t know <i>him<\\/i>. But I never see a nigger that <i>wouldn\\u2019t<\\/i> lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIn the daytime?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCertainly.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWith his face to the stump?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes. Least I reckon so.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDid he say anything?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t reckon he did. I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! Why, that ain\\u2019t a-going to do any good. You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there\\u2019s a spunk-water stump, and just as it\\u2019s midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:<\\/p> <p>\\u2018Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,\\u2019<\\/p> <p>and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm\\u2019s busted.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, that sounds like a good way; but that ain\\u2019t the way Bob Tanner done.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, sir, you can bet he didn\\u2019t, becuz he\\u2019s the wartiest boy in this town; and he wouldn\\u2019t have a wart on him if he\\u2019d knowed how to work spunk-water. I\\u2019ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I\\u2019ve always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take \\u2019em off with a bean.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, bean\\u2019s good. I\\u2019ve done that.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHave you? What\\u2019s your way?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it \\u2019bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece that\\u2019s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off she comes.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, that\\u2019s it, Huck\\u2014that\\u2019s it; though when you\\u2019re burying it if you say \\u2018Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!\\u2019 it\\u2019s better. That\\u2019s the way Joe Harper does, and he\\u2019s been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say\\u2014how do you cure \\u2019em with dead cats?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard \\u2019long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it\\u2019s midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can\\u2019t see \\u2019em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear \\u2019em talk; and when they\\u2019re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after \\u2019em and say, \\u2018Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I\\u2019m done with ye!\\u2019 That\\u2019ll fetch <i>any<\\/i> wart.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSounds right. D\\u2019you ever try it, Huck?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, but old Mother Hopkins told me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I reckon it\\u2019s so, then. Becuz they say she\\u2019s a witch.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay! Why, Tom, I <i>know<\\/i> she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn\\u2019t dodged, he\\u2019d a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off\\u2019n a shed wher\\u2019 he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, that\\u2019s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy, they\\u2019re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when they mumble they\\u2019re saying the Lord\\u2019s Prayer backards.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img067\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"06-067.jpg (48K)\\" src=\\"\\/54774a8dd281097c34f000cb0008e8d5c512fdf3.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTo-night.

I\\u2019m satisfied with it. It\\u2019s a good enough tick for me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSho, there\\u2019s ticks a plenty.

Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIs it genuwyne?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, all right,\\u201d said Huckleberry, \\u201cit\\u2019s a trade.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinchbug\\u2019s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than before.<\\/p> <p>When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThomas Sawyer!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSir!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCome up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love; and by that form was <i>the only vacant place<\\/i> on the girls\\u2019 side of the school-house. He instantly said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!<\\/i>\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The master\\u2019s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind. The master said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou\\u2014you did what?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cStopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>There was no mistaking the words.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your jacket.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img069\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"06-069.jpg (48K)\\" src=\\"\\/4350e66380f4e4099faa297616c974d303e5da72.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The master\\u2019s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.<\\/p> <p>By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, \\u201cmade a mouth\\u201d at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, \\u201cPlease take it\\u2014I got more.\\u201d The girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLet me see it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img070\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"06-070.jpg (26K)\\" src=\\"\\/4a18ea960b4453056d8a1d06d5d8facfc45af7f0.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl\\u2019s interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s nice\\u2014make a man.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a beautiful man\\u2014now make me coming along.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s ever so nice\\u2014I wish I could draw.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s easy,\\u201d whispered Tom, \\u201cI\\u2019ll learn you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, will you? When?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAt noon. Do you go home to dinner?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll stay if you will.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGood\\u2014that\\u2019s a whack. What\\u2019s your name?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecky Thatcher. What\\u2019s yours? Oh, I know. It\\u2019s Thomas Sawyer.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s the name they lick me by. I\\u2019m Tom when I\\u2019m good. You call me Tom, will you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, it ain\\u2019t anything.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes it is.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo it ain\\u2019t. You don\\u2019t want to see.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll tell.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo I won\\u2019t\\u2014deed and deed and double deed won\\u2019t.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou won\\u2019t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, I won\\u2019t ever tell <i>any<\\/i>body. Now let me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, <i>you<\\/i> don\\u2019t want to see!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow that you treat me so, I <i>will<\\/i> see.\\u201d And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed: \\u201c<i>I love you<\\/i>.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, you bad thing!\\u201d And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.<\\/p> <p>Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But although Tom\\u2019s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img071\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"06-071.jpg (46K)\\" src=\\"\\/c799f4efa04f52787b49a62f754bbd664d4153f1.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and got \\u201cturned down,\\u201d by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c7\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00011\\">CHAPTER VII<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img072\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"07-072.jpg (175K)\\" src=\\"\\/af7ed8a8373728b67af17dccc8d2fedd3359e63b.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom\\u2019s heart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.<\\/p> <p>Tom\\u2019s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he put Joe\\u2019s slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow,\\u201d said he, \\u201cas long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I\\u2019ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you\\u2019re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAll right, go ahead; start him up.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom\\u2019s fingers would be twitching to begin, Joe\\u2019s pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, you let him alone.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, sir, it ain\\u2019t fair; you just let him alone.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBlame it, I ain\\u2019t going to stir him much.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLet him alone, I tell you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou shall\\u2014he\\u2019s on my side of the line.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t care whose tick he is\\u2014he\\u2019s on my side of the line, and you sha\\u2019n\\u2019t touch him.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll just bet I will, though. He\\u2019s my tick and I\\u2019ll do what I blame please with him, or die!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>A tremendous whack came down on Tom\\u2019s shoulders, and its duplicate on Joe\\u2019s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it.<\\/p> <p>When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered in her ear:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cPut on your bonnet and let on you\\u2019re going home; and when you get to the corner, give the rest of \\u2019em the slip, and turn down through the lane and come back. I\\u2019ll go the other way and come it over \\u2019em the same way.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDo you love rats?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo! I hate them!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I do, too\\u2014<i>live<\\/i> ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head with a string.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDo you? I\\u2019ve got some. I\\u2019ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it back to me.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWas you ever at a circus?\\u201d said Tom.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, and my pa\\u2019s going to take me again some time, if I\\u2019m good.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI been to the circus three or four times\\u2014lots of times. Church ain\\u2019t shucks to a circus. There\\u2019s things going on at a circus all the time. I\\u2019m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, are you! That will be nice. They\\u2019re so lovely, all spotted up.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, that\\u2019s so. And they get slathers of money\\u2014most a dollar a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, engaged to be married.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWould you like to?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI reckon so. I don\\u2019t know. What is it like?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLike? Why it ain\\u2019t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won\\u2019t ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that\\u2019s all. Anybody can do it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cKiss? What do you kiss for?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, that, you know, is to\\u2014well, they always do that.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cEverybody?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, yes, everybody that\\u2019s in love with each other. Do you remember what I wrote on the slate?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYe\\u2014yes.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat was it?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI sha\\u2019n\\u2019t tell you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cShall I tell <i>you<\\/i>?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYe\\u2014yes\\u2014but some other time.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, now.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, not now\\u2014to-morrow.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, no, <i>now<\\/i>. Please, Becky\\u2014I\\u2019ll whisper it, I\\u2019ll whisper it ever so easy.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear. And then he added:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow you whisper it to me\\u2014just the same.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She resisted, for a while, and then said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYou turn your face away so you can\\u2019t see, and then I will. But you mustn\\u2019t ever tell anybody\\u2014<i>will<\\/i> you, Tom? Now you won\\u2019t, <i>will<\\/i> you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, indeed, indeed I won\\u2019t. Now, Becky.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered, \\u201cI\\u2014love\\u2014you!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, Becky, it\\u2019s all done\\u2014all over but the kiss. Don\\u2019t you be afraid of that\\u2014it ain\\u2019t anything at all. Please, Becky.\\u201d And he tugged at her apron and the hands.<\\/p> <p>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow it\\u2019s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain\\u2019t ever to love anybody but me, and you ain\\u2019t ever to marry anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, I\\u2019ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I\\u2019ll never marry anybody but you\\u2014and you ain\\u2019t to ever marry anybody but me, either.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cCertainly. Of course. That\\u2019s <i>part<\\/i> of it. And always coming to school or when we\\u2019re going home, you\\u2019re to walk with me, when there ain\\u2019t anybody looking\\u2014and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because that\\u2019s the way you do when you\\u2019re engaged.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s so nice. I never heard of it before.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, it\\u2019s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, Tom! Then I ain\\u2019t the first you\\u2019ve ever been engaged to!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The child began to cry. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, don\\u2019t cry, Becky, I don\\u2019t care for her any more.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, you do, Tom\\u2014you know you do.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img077\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> "}';
