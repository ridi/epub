During the first half-hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher\\u2019s house, seized the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher\\u2019s hand, tried to speak but couldn\\u2019t\\u2014and drifted out raining tears all over the place.<\\/p> <p>Aunt Polly\\u2019s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher\\u2019s nearly so. It would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by!<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img249\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"32-249.jpg (97K)\\" src=\\"\\/547ec23d910193f240f6dde848c9bf58507da8d4.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn\\u2019t believe the wild tale at first, \\u201cbecause,\\u201d said they, \\u201cyou are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in\\u201d\\u2014then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.<\\/p> <p>Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind them, and informed of the great news.<\\/p> <p>Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday, was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.<\\/p> <p>Tom learned of Huck\\u2019s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the \\u201cragged man\\u2019s\\u201d body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.<\\/p> <p>About a fortnight after Tom\\u2019s rescue from the cave, he started off to visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher\\u2019s house was on Tom\\u2019s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn\\u2019t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he thought he wouldn\\u2019t mind it. The Judge said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, there are others just like you, Tom, I\\u2019ve not the least doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any more.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cBecause I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and triple-locked\\u2014and I\\u2019ve got the keys.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom turned as white as a sheet.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The water was brought and thrown into Tom\\u2019s face.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAh, now you\\u2019re all right.

Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.<\\/p> <p>When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img253\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"33-253.jpg (90K)\\" src=\\"\\/0dbc1daaa729e8728c3a61b782ed429ad3eb11ba.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>Injun Joe\\u2019s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something\\u2014in order to pass the weary time\\u2014in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick\\u2014a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was \\u201cnews.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img254\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"33-254.jpg (46K)\\" src=\\"\\/f076aba1ccd86b971c14166fa301fa91fdd66f95.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect\\u2019s need? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal\\u2019s cave. Injun Joe\\u2019s cup stands first in the list of the cavern\\u2019s marvels; even \\u201cAladdin\\u2019s Palace\\u201d cannot rival it.<\\/p> <p>Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img255\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"33-255.jpg (70K)\\" src=\\"\\/b3bb3b35fcc72103867db26a2d719056212471be.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing\\u2014the petition to the governor for Injun Joe\\u2019s pardon. The petition had been largely signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water-works.<\\/p> <p>The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom\\u2019s adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now. Huck\\u2019s face saddened. He said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must \\u2019a\\u2019 ben you, soon as I heard \\u2019bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn\\u2019t got the money becuz you\\u2019d \\u2019a\\u2019 got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something\\u2019s always told me we\\u2019d never get holt of that swag.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. <i>You<\\/i> know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don\\u2019t you remember you was to watch there that night?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh yes! Why, it seems \\u2019bout a year ago. It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder\\u2019s.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>You<\\/i> followed him?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2014but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe\\u2019s left friends behind him, and I don\\u2019t want \\u2019em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn\\u2019t ben for me he\\u2019d be down in Texas now, all right.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard of the Welshman\\u2019s part of it before.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell,\\u201d said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, \\u201cwhoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon\\u2014anyways it\\u2019s a goner for us, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, that money wasn\\u2019t ever in No. 2!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat!\\u201d Huck searched his comrade\\u2019s face keenly. \\u201cTom, have you got on the track of that money again?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, it\\u2019s in the cave!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck\\u2019s eyes blazed.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSay it again, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThe money\\u2019s in the cave!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom\\u2014honest injun, now\\u2014is it fun, or earnest?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cEarnest, Huck\\u2014just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in there with me and help get it out?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI bet I will! I will if it\\u2019s where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGood as wheat! What makes you think the money\\u2019s\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don\\u2019t find it I\\u2019ll agree to give you my drum and every thing I\\u2019ve got in the world. I will, by jings.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAll right\\u2014it\\u2019s a whiz. When do you say?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cRight now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIs it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now, but I can\\u2019t walk more\\u2019n a mile, Tom\\u2014least I don\\u2019t think I could.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck, but there\\u2019s a mighty short cut that they don\\u2019t anybody but me know about. Huck, I\\u2019ll take you right to it in a skiff. I\\u2019ll float the skiff down there, and I\\u2019ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn\\u2019t ever turn your hand over.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLess start right off, Tom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAll right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many\\u2019s the time I wished I had some when I was in there before.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles below \\u201cCave Hollow,\\u201d Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow\\u2014no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see that white place up yonder where there\\u2019s been a landslide? Well, that\\u2019s one of my marks. We\\u2019ll get ashore, now.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img257\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"33-257.jpg (95K)\\" src=\\"\\/2c26ea969613b46fc5db7d64a2c762db55f7c247.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>They landed.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, Huck, where we\\u2019re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHere you are! Look at it, Huck; it\\u2019s the snuggest hole in this country. You just keep mum about it. All along I\\u2019ve been wanting to be a robber, but I knew I\\u2019d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across it was the bother. We\\u2019ve got it now, and we\\u2019ll keep it quiet, only we\\u2019ll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in\\u2014because of course there\\u2019s got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn\\u2019t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer\\u2019s Gang\\u2014it sounds splendid, don\\u2019t it, Huck?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, it just does, Tom. And who\\u2019ll we rob?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, most anybody. Waylay people\\u2014that\\u2019s mostly the way.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd kill them?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s a ransom?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMoney. You make them raise all they can, off\\u2019n their friends; and after you\\u2019ve kept them a year, if it ain\\u2019t raised then you kill them. That\\u2019s the general way. Only you don\\u2019t kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don\\u2019t kill them. They\\u2019re always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain\\u2019t anybody as polite as robbers\\u2014you\\u2019ll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they\\u2019ve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn\\u2019t get them to leave. If you drove them out they\\u2019d turn right around and come back. It\\u2019s so in all the books.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, it\\u2019s real bully, Tom. I believe it\\u2019s better\\u2019n to be a pirate.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes, it\\u2019s better in some ways, because it\\u2019s close to home and circuses and all that.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.<\\/p> <p>The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and followed Tom\\u2019s other corridor until they reached the \\u201cjumping-off place.\\u201d The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high. Tom whispered:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow I\\u2019ll show you something, Huck.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He held his candle aloft and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLook as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There\\u2014on the big rock over yonder\\u2014done with candle-smoke.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, it\\u2019s a <i>cross<\\/i>!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201c<i>Now<\\/i> where\\u2019s your Number Two? \\u2018<i>under the cross<\\/i>,\\u2019 hey? Right yonder\\u2019s where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, less git out of here!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat! and leave the treasure?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes\\u2014leave it. Injun Joe\\u2019s ghost is round about there, certain.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo it ain\\u2019t, Huck, no it ain\\u2019t. It would ha\\u2019nt the place where he died\\u2014away out at the mouth of the cave\\u2014five mile from here.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, Tom, it wouldn\\u2019t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of ghosts, and so do you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him\\u2014<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLookyhere, Huck, what fools we\\u2019re making of ourselves! Injun Joe\\u2019s ghost ain\\u2019t a going to come around where there\\u2019s a cross!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The point was well taken. It had its effect.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, I didn\\u2019t think of that. But that\\u2019s so. It\\u2019s luck for us, that cross is. I reckon we\\u2019ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHe said <i>under<\\/i> the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It can\\u2019t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cLookyhere, Huck, there\\u2019s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what\\u2019s that for? I bet you the money <i>is<\\/i> under the rock. I\\u2019m going to dig in the clay.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThat ain\\u2019t no bad notion, Tom!\\u201d said Huck with animation.<\\/p> <p>Tom\\u2019s \\u201creal Barlow\\u201d was out at once, and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHey, Huck!\\u2014you hear that?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMy goodness, Huck, lookyhere!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGot it at last!\\u201d said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand. \\u201cMy, but we\\u2019re rich, Tom!\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img261\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"33-261.jpg (97K)\\" src=\\"\\/2287b150f016903b2b9d8fc69dc9a91b1dc1cb74.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck, I always reckoned we\\u2019d get it. It\\u2019s just too good to believe, but we <i>have<\\/i> got it, sure! Say\\u2014let\\u2019s not fool around here. Let\\u2019s snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI thought so,\\u201d he said; \\u201c<i>They<\\/i> carried it like it was heavy, that day at the ha\\u2019nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching the little bags along.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow less fetch the guns and things,\\u201d said Huck.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNo, Huck\\u2014leave them there. They\\u2019re just the tricks to have when we go to robbing. We\\u2019ll keep them there all the time, and we\\u2019ll hold our orgies there, too. It\\u2019s an awful snug place for orgies.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhat orgies?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we\\u2019ve got to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we\\u2019ve been in here a long time. It\\u2019s getting late, I reckon. I\\u2019m hungry, too. We\\u2019ll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, Huck,\\u201d said Tom, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll hide the money in the loft of the widow\\u2019s woodshed, and I\\u2019ll come up in the morning and we\\u2019ll count it and divide, and then we\\u2019ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor\\u2019s little wagon; I won\\u2019t be gone a minute.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman\\u2019s house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHallo, who\\u2019s that?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck and Tom Sawyer.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cGood! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here\\u2014hurry up, trot ahead\\u2014I\\u2019ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it\\u2019s not as light as it might be. Got bricks in it?\\u2014or old metal?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOld metal,\\u201d said Tom.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bits\\u2019 worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that\\u2019s human nature\\u2014hurry along, hurry along!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNever mind; you\\u2019ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas\\u2019.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Huck said with some apprehension\\u2014for he was long used to being falsely accused:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cMr. Jones, we haven\\u2019t been doing nothing.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The Welshman laughed.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t know, Huck, my boy. I don\\u2019t know about that. Ain\\u2019t you and the widow good friends?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cYes. Well, she\\u2019s ben good friends to me, anyway.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAll right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>This question was not entirely answered in Huck\\u2019s slow mind before he found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas\\u2019 drawing-room. Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.<\\/p> <p>The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom wasn\\u2019t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAnd you did just right,\\u201d said the widow. \\u201cCome with me, boys.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>She took them to a bedchamber and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes\\u2014shirts, socks, everything complete. They\\u2019re Huck\\u2019s\\u2014no, no thanks, Huck\\u2014Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they\\u2019ll fit both of you. Get into them.

I\\u2019ll take care of you.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Sid appeared.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom,\\u201d said he, \\u201cauntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.

Say\\u2014ain\\u2019t this grease and clay, on your clothes?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cNow, Mr. Siddy, you jist \\u2019tend to your own business. What\\u2019s all this blowout about, anyway?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s one of the widow\\u2019s parties that she\\u2019s always having. This time it\\u2019s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night. And say\\u2014I can tell you something, if you want to know.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, what?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cWhy, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a secret, but I reckon it\\u2019s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows\\u2014the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don\\u2019t. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here\\u2014couldn\\u2019t get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSecret about what, Sid?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cAbout Huck tracking the robbers to the widow\\u2019s. I reckon Mr. Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop pretty flat.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSid, was it you that told?\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cOh, never mind who it was. <i>Somebody<\\/i> told\\u2014that\\u2019s enough.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSid, there\\u2019s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and that\\u2019s you. If you had been in Huck\\u2019s place you\\u2019d \\u2019a\\u2019 sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can\\u2019t do any but mean things, and you can\\u2019t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. There\\u2014no thanks, as the widow says\\u201d\\u2014and Tom cuffed Sid\\u2019s ears and helped him to the door with several kicks. \\u201cNow go and tell auntie if you dare\\u2014and tomorrow you\\u2019ll catch it!\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Some minutes later the widow\\u2019s guests were at the supper-table, and a dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room, after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was another person whose modesty\\u2014<\\/p> <p>And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck\\u2019s share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However, the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody\\u2019s gaze and everybody\\u2019s laudations.<\\/p> <p>The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way. Tom\\u2019s chance was come. He said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck don\\u2019t need it. Huck\\u2019s rich.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cHuck\\u2019s got money. Maybe you don\\u2019t believe it, but he\\u2019s got lots of it. Oh, you needn\\u2019t smile\\u2014I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed interest\\u2014and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cSid, what ails Tom?\\u201d said Aunt Polly. \\u201cHe\\u2014well, there ain\\u2019t ever any making of that boy out. I never\\u2014\\u201d<\\/p> <p>Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cThere\\u2014what did I tell you? Half of it\\u2019s Huck\\u2019s and half of it\\u2019s mine!\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img266\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"34-266.jpg (106K)\\" src=\\"\\/a96e3042b0e52ef55f1a76465257d37704104f60.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don\\u2019t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I\\u2019m willing to allow.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before, though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property.<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img267\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"34-267.jpg (20K)\\" src=\\"\\/806aaee5de4403ce133f31f96bee5d68d81c0a7a.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"c35\\"><\\/a><\\/p> <h2 id=\\"pgepubid00040\\">CHAPTER XXXV<\\/h2> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img268\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"35-268.jpg (189K)\\" src=\\"\\/94e5933d20ac59640da57c5cddbb1d62a68405c5.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom\\u2019s and Huck\\u2019s windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every \\u201chaunted\\u201d house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure\\u2014and not by boys, but men\\u2014pretty grave, unromantic men, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper published biographical sketches of the boys.<\\/p> <p>The Widow Douglas put Huck\\u2019s money out at six per cent., and Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom\\u2019s at Aunt Polly\\u2019s request. Each lad had an income, now, that was simply prodigious\\u2014a dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got\\u2014no, it was what he was promised\\u2014he generally couldn\\u2019t collect it. A dollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old simple days\\u2014and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.<\\/p> <p>Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her whipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie\\u2014a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with George Washington\\u2019s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight off and told Tom about it.<\\/p> <p>Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or both.<\\/p> <p>Huck Finn\\u2019s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas\\u2019 protection introduced him into society\\u2014no, dragged him into it, hurled him into it\\u2014and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The widow\\u2019s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.<\\/p> <p>He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee. Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home. Huck\\u2019s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He said:<\\/p> <p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t talk about it, Tom. I\\u2019ve tried it, and it don\\u2019t work; it don\\u2019t work, Tom. It ain\\u2019t for me; I ain\\u2019t used to it. The widder\\u2019s good to me, and friendly; but I can\\u2019t stand them ways. She makes me get up just at the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won\\u2019t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don\\u2019t seem to any air git through \\u2019em, somehow; and they\\u2019re so rotten nice that I can\\u2019t set down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher\\u2019s; I hain\\u2019t slid on a cellar-door for\\u2014well, it \\u2019pears to be years; I got to go to church and sweat and sweat\\u2014I hate them ornery sermons!

The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell\\u2014everything\\u2019s so awful reg\\u2019lar a body can\\u2019t stand it.\\u201d<\\/p> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <a id=\\"img271\\"><\\/a><br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <div class=\\"fig c2\\"><img alt=\\"35-271.jpg (112K)\\" src=\\"\\/3005b5740a76d9cb9e316af43b428c1528a4b7ff.jpg\\" class=\\"c1\\" \\/><br \\/><\\/div> <p><br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/> <br \\/><\\/p> <p>\\u201cWell, everybody does that way, Huck.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>\\u201cTom, it don\\u2019t make no difference.
